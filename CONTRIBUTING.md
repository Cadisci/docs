# Contributing to GPT Engineer Docs

Thank you for considering contributing to the GPT Engineer documentation! We appreciate your effort in improving the docs for everyone. Here’s a quick guide to help you get started.

## How to contribute

### 1. Find an area to improve
- Visit our docs at [https://docs.gptengineer.app/](https://docs.gptengineer.app/).
- Browse through the pages and if you find something that can be improved — from fixing typos to adding more content — go ahead and contribute.
- We are very interested in tutorials, tips and tricks, and ideas covering the real-world usage of GPT Engineer. 

### 2. Edit the page
- On each page, you will see a **"Edit this page"** button. Click on it and you will be redirected to the respective page in this repository.
- This opens the file directly in GitHub, and you can make the necessary changes.

#### Video tutorial

We also have a tutorial video to help guide you through the process of editing the docs. You can watch it directly below:

## Guidelines

- Keep the language simple and clear. We aim for concise and straightforward documentation.
- Make sure your markdown syntax is correct, and use proper formatting for headings, code blocks, links, etc.
- Check that your contribution aligns with the structure and tone of the existing documentation.
- For larger contributions (e.g., new sections or topics), consider opening an issue first to discuss your ideas.
