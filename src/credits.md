# :medal: Messaging limits

LLMs are expensive, because of this GPT Engineer limits the daily and/or monthly messages that result in successful edits you can send.

!!! info "Edits expiration"
    Daily edits renew at midnight UTC.


## All plans
- **Daily limit** - 5 free messages per day

Designed to give users a chance to explore and experience GPT Engineer's features at no cost.

!!! info "What happens if my edit fails?"
    If an edit generation fails due to an error on our side, the credit for that edit will **not** be deducted from your daily/monthly total.

## Legacy plans
Some early access users are "grandfathered" on their existing plans, but can choose to move to the new plans before the old ("pro") plan is officially deprecated.

## Available plans
