# :simple-github: GitHub integration


To make it easier for developers to work together with the AI on projects, gptengineer.app backs all projects with a git repository, and lets you push commits yourself directly to the repository.

In order to push commits to the GitHub your project, and gptengineer.app will automatically pull them in and update the project. This allows you to make changes yourself, without asking the AI.

## Connecting a project to your GitHub account

Before pushing your first commit, you will need to connect your GitHub account to the project. You can do this by navigating to the GitHub -> Create Repository -> Add another account. You will then be redirected to GitHub to authorize the connection.

You can pick any option between granting access to (1) all repositories, or (2) specific repositories, as both will authorise is to create repositories in your GitHub account.

Please note that you will need to have admin access if you are trying to create a repository in an organization.

## Making changes to a project through commits 

Once you have connected your GitHub account to your project, you can view the source code by navigating to the GitHub -> View on GitHub.

Any change you make and push to the repository will be automatically reflected in the gptengineer.app.

You commit changes directly in GitHub Codespaces or clone the repo to use your preferred IDE.
