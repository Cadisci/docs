## Supported Tech Stacks

### Default Tech Stack: shadcn/ui

Our default setup uses the <a href="https://github.com/shadcn/ui" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shadcn/ui</a> library, providing a robust and popular frontend framework.

### Experimental Tech Stack: shadcn/ui + TypeScript
In addition to our default tech stack, now you can try out the same trusted shadcn/ui stack - but with TypeScript support.

### Custom Tech Stack

If you have specific requirements for a different tech stack, select "Custom Tech Stack" from the dropdown menu. This will open <a href="https://antonosika.typeform.com/to/KbocJ7pz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this form</a> where you can provide details about your desired stack.

We will review and consider these requests for future implementation.
