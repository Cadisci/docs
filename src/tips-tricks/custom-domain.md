# :earth_africa: Setting up a custom domain

When you create a project, GPT Engineer makes it easy to [publish it](../features/deploy.md) by simply clicking on a button. However, we don't support custom domains (yet). 

However, if having a custom domain is important to you, then there are a few ways you can achieve this.

## Using Netlify (Recommended)

You can host on Netlify for free with a custom domain, but you need to purchase the domain separately, and advanced features may require a paid plan.

To use Netlify you will need to follow these steps (it takes less than a minute!):
- Deploy your project using Netlify - instructions [here](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/)
- Configure a custom domain for your Netlify site - instructions [here](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/#assign-a-domain-to-a-production-site)
