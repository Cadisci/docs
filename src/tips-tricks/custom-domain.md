# :earth_africa: Setting up a custom domain

When you create a project, GPT Engineer makes it easy to [publish it](../features/deploy.md) with the click of a button.

If you want to have a custom domain, see below.

## Using Netlify (<1 minute)

You can host on Netlify for free with a custom domain, you do need to purchase the domain yourself.

The steps are:

1. Open your project in gptengineer.app and click GitHub then "create repository" if you haven't already done so.
2. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=PASTE_YOUR_GITHUB_PROJECTS_URL_HERE and follow instructions
3. Configure a custom domain for your Netlify site, instructions [here](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/#assign-a-domain-to-a-production-site)
