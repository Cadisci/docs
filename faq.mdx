  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I import existing code from GitHub?">
    No, this isn't something we support at the moment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I build a privileges system for a SaaS app?">
    * Use **Supabase authentication** to create user roles (Admin, User, Guest).

    * Implement **Row-Level Security (RLS)** for data access control.

    * Use **Edge Functions** for API-level permissions.

    * Test your setup to prevent security leaks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will Lovable improve my prompts without using my credits?">
    Improving prompts may count toward your **usage limit**, but Lovable optimizes responses to minimize unnecessary interactions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to know how to code to build an app ?">
    No, you don’t need to be a technical developer to code with AI. AI coding tools like Lovable allow you to build applications by following a structured workflow: plan, prompt, scaffold, debug, and deploy. You can start by brainstorming your project idea, generate project documentation, and then use AI to scaffold and debug step by step. By breaking the process down and providing clear instructions to AI, you can effectively build and deploy an app without prior coding experience.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I learn how to code with Lovable?">
    To effectively learn coding basics while using Lovable, the most impactful strategy is to actively observe how it writes code. Our brains are naturally adept at recognizing patterns, so by watching Lovable in action and engaging with the explanations provided in the chat, you’ll start to identify common coding patterns and concepts. This combination of visual learning and contextual understanding will greatly enhance your coding skills.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does it typically take to build and deploy a fully functional full-stack app?">
    The complexity of what you're building plays a significant role in the approach you take. There’s no one-size-fits-all rule, but patience and thoughtful prompting are key. Plan ahead, break down feature development into smaller, manageable pieces, and continuously assess and learn from any errors that arise. This will help ensure a smoother and more rewarding building experience.

    We're thrilled that you're considering building with Lovable! Embrace this journey as an opportunity to learn, experiment, and grow.

## Code and Development

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I download the code Lovable generates?">
    Yes, you can easily get access to the code generated by Lovable via our [GitHub integration](/integrations/git-integration).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Lovable with my own backend?">
    Absolutely! Lovable can generate code that connects to any backend. While connecting to most backends may require some technical knowledge, we’ve made it easy to use [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and its [native integration with Lovable](integrations/supabase).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can Lovable write React Native/NextJS code?">
    No, Lovable can only generate applications based on Vite and React at the moment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does Lovable handles duplicated code?">
    Previously, when adding functionality, the AI sometimes created duplicate files, causing confusion and errors where changes were applied to a hidden duplicate instead of the visible file.&#x20;

    This update ensures the system now detects and excludes duplicate files, significantly reducing "could not be applied" errors.&#x20;

    As a result, users—especially those building larger applications—will experience more reliable AI behavior, with changes correctly applied and fewer inconsistencies. This fix is automatically applied to all projects, requiring no action from users, and is part of our ongoing effort to enhance AI accuracy and scalability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is a webhook, and how does it work?">
    A **webhook** is a way for two applications to communicate automatically. It acts as a “listener” that waits for specific events and triggers an action in response.

    For example, in Lovable:

    1. A user submits a form.

    2. The form data is sent to a webhook URL (like an API endpoint).

    3. The webhook processes the data and triggers another action, such as storing the information in a database or sending an email notification.

    **Key uses of webhooks:**

    * **Real-time automation** – instantly process incoming data.

    * **Integrations with external tools** – connect Lovable with services like Slack, Stripe, or Supabase.

    * **Handling API responses** – send data between systems without manual intervention.

    When using webhooks, always:

    * **Ensure the webhook URL is correct and secure** to prevent data leaks.

    * **Handle responses properly** – Lovable should expect a return confirmation to ensure successful execution.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is refactoring, and why is it important?">
    **Refactoring** is the process of improving the structure, readability, and efficiency of existing code without changing its functionality. It’s like editing a long essay to make it more concise while keeping the same message.

    In AI-generated development, refactoring can help:

    * **Optimize performance** by reducing redundant code.

    * **Improve maintainability** for easier debugging and future updates.

    * **Prevent conflicts** by organizing logic more clearly.

    However, unnecessary refactoring can introduce bugs. Before refactoring, always:

    * **Ask AI what it plans to change** (e.g., in Lovable’s Chat Mode).

    * **Ensure all dependencies remain functional** to avoid breaking other parts of your application.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Lovable for frontend development?">
