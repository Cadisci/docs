## Can I download the code Lovable generates?

Yes, you can easily get access to the code generated by Lovable via our [GitHub integration](/integrations/git-integration).

## Can I use Lovable with my own backend?

Absolutely! Lovable can generate code that connects to any backend. While connecting to most backends may require some technical knowledge, we’ve made it easy to use [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and its [native integration with Lovable](integrations/supabase).

## What is Lovable's Chat-Only Mode?

Chat-Only Mode is an experimental feature designed to enhance your workflow by allowing you to interact with Lovable through chat without directly editing your project.

Here’s how it can help:

* **Planning:** Brainstorm new features, evaluate ideas, and weigh pros and cons before diving into implementation.

* **Troubleshooting:** Work through challenges by asking the AI to explore how parts of your app function, helping you identify and solve problems more effectively.

* **Understanding:** Gain deeper insights into how your code works, verify implementations, and clarify complex processes after changes are made.

You can enable Chat-Only Mode by navigating to global Settings -> Account Settings -> selecting Labs.

## Can I import existing code from GitHub?

No, this isn't something we support at the moment.

## Does every message I send count towards my monthly limit?

Going forward, messages triggered by “Ask the AI to fix” won’t count toward your usage limits.

All other messages—regardless of the outcome—will still count. We believe this will encourage us to improve “Ask the AI to fix” and at the same time makes it easier for you to use without worrying about usage limits.

See [here](/user-guides/messaging-limits) for more information.

Notice that this is different than the message count shown in the sidebar, which always increments for tracking purposes but does not reflect deductions from your credits when using “Ask the AI to fix.” If you notice any issues where credits are deducted incorrectly, please contact our support team so we can promptly resolve it.

## Can I top-up my monthly limit?

No, you can't at the moment. We recommend you to upgrade to a higher plan and then downgrade once you've used up your messages.

## How can I start my project with Lovable?

There are several ways to get started with Lovable, depending on your preferences and resources:

1. **Prompting:** Lovable’s prompt-based system makes app creation simple. Just describe what you want to build in the prompt box. The more specific you are, the better the results. Example: *“Create a dashboard with user login, monthly sales in a line chart, and customer demographics in a pie chart.”* Start with clear and detailed prompts. You can refine and adjust your project as you go.

2. **Templates**: Lovable offers [templates](https://lovable.dev/templates) to help you get started quickly on popular project types, such as dashboards, e-commerce sites, or social apps, for a quick setup. Once the template loads, use prompts to adjust features, add new elements, or fine-tune the design to match your vision.

3. **Remix**: You can remix an existing public project or one of your own. Remixing allows you to reuse the current state of a project as a starting point and build upon it. It’s a great way to explore new ideas, make adjustments, or iterate with different changes while preserving the original version. Note that it is not possible to remix projects when Supabase is connected.

4. **Using Figma**: If you have a design in Figma, take a screenshot of any part of it. You can paste the screenshot directly into Lovable or drag-and-drop the image file. Once you press Enter, Lovable will convert your design into functional code.

5. **Sketching with** [**Excalidraw**](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw)**:** Use Excalidraw or any similar tool to sketch your UI. Take a screenshot of your drawing, then paste or drag-and-drop it into Lovable. The platform will transform your sketch into working code.

6. **Cloning a Website or Application:** If you want to replicate an existing webpage, take a screenshot using shortcuts like *Cmd+Shift+4* on Mac or tools like the [GoFullPage Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gofullpage-full-page-scre/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl). Paste or drag the screenshot into Lovable, and it will recreate the structure of the webpage in your project.

Each of these methods helps you kickstart your project with ease and flexibility.

## How do I remove the Lovable badge from my app?

You can easily toggle the Lovable badge on or off directly from your project settings. Simply navigate to the project settings sidebar and adjust the "Show Lovable Badge" option for your deployed app.

## How can I make improvements to my project?

Lovable provides multiple ways to update and refine your project:

1. **Refine Components**: Adjust prompts for specific changes, e.g., “Make the header smaller.

2. **Add Features**: Use prompts like “Add a user registration page.”

3. **Select-to-Edit**: Click on specific components (e.g., button, section) to edit directly.

4. **Version History**: Access previous versions to restore or compare changes.

## Is there any Lovable available API?

No, we don’t offer an API at the moment.

## How Does Lovable AI's Memory Work?

Lovable AI operates with a limited memory context, meaning it focuses on recent messages for optimal understanding. To ensure the best results when referencing older conversations, include any relevant context in your current message. This helps the AI provide accurate and coherent responses.

## Can Lovable build Mobile apps (iOS and Android)?

No, Lovable can only build web apps at the moment.
