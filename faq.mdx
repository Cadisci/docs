  <Accordion title="How can I start my project with Lovable?">
    There are several ways to get started with Lovable, depending on your preferences and resources:

    1. **Prompting**
       Lovable’s prompt-based system makes app creation simple. Just describe what you want to build in the prompt box. The more specific you are, the better the results. Start with clear and detailed prompts. You can refine and adjust your project as you go. Example: *"Create a dashboard with user login, monthly sales in a line chart, and customer demographics in a pie chart."*

    2. **Templates**
       Lovable offers [templates](https://lovable.dev/templates) to help you get started quickly on popular project types, such as dashboards, e-commerce sites, or social apps, for a quick setup. Once the template loads, use prompts to adjust features, add new elements, or fine-tune the design to match your vision.

    3. **Remix**
       You can remix an existing public project or one of your own. Remixing allows you to reuse the current state of a project as a starting point and build upon it. It’s a great way to explore new ideas, make adjustments, or iterate with different changes while preserving the original version. Note that it is not possible to remix projects when Supabase is connected.

    4. **Using Figma**
       If you have a design in Figma, take a screenshot of any part of it. You can paste the screenshot directly into Lovable or drag-and-drop the image file. Once you press Enter, Lovable will convert your design into functional code.

    5. **Sketching with [**Excalidraw**](https://excalidraw.com/)**
       Use Excalidraw or any similar tool to sketch your UI. Take a screenshot of your drawing, then paste or drag-and-drop it into Lovable. The platform will transform your sketch into working code.

    6. **Cloning a Website or Application**
       If you want to replicate an existing webpage, take a screenshot using shortcuts like *Cmd+Shift+4* on Mac or tools like the [GoFullPage Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gofullpage-full-page-scre/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl). Paste or drag the screenshot into Lovable, and it will recreate the structure of the webpage in your project.

    Each of these methods helps you kickstart your project with ease and flexibility.

  <Accordion title="Can I import existing code from GitHub?">
    No, this isn't something we support at the moment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is refactoring really needed?">
    Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior. The primary goal is to improve maintainability, readability, and scalability while reducing technical debt. However, whether refactoring is "really needed" depends on the context in which the code operates.

    **When Refactoring Is Beneficial**

    * **Improves Readability**: Well-structured code is easier to understand and maintain.

    * **Reduces Redundancy**: Eliminates duplicate code and enhances reusability.

    * **Enhances Performance**: Optimizes inefficient logic and improves execution speed.

    * **Facilitates Scaling**: Makes it easier to extend features without breaking existing functionality.

    * **Simplifies Debugging**: Cleaner code with modular components is easier to debug.

    **When Refactoring Can Cause Issues**

    * **Unnecessary Changes**: If the code is already functional and maintainable, excessive refactoring can introduce new bugs.

    * **Loss of Context**: If dependencies and interactions between files are not well understood, refactoring may break the code.

    * **Circular Dependencies**: Moving functions across files without considering imports and references can cause errors.

    * **AI-Generated Code Limitations**: If using AI for refactoring, the AI might lack full project context, leading to incorrect restructuring.

    **How to Avoid Errors Related to Refactoring**

    1. **Understand the Code First:** Before refactoring, ensure you fully understand the existing logic, dependencies, and interactions between files.

    2. **Refactor in Small Steps**: Instead of making large-scale changes, modify one section at a time and test frequently. Use version control to track changes and revert if necessary.

    3. **Check for Circular Dependencies**: Be mindful when splitting large files into multiple modules to avoid import loops.&#x20;

    4. **Use AI for Analysis, Not Just Refactoring**: Instead of asking AI to refactor blindly, prompt it to analyze dependencies and suggest improvements using the chat mode only. Request explanations before accepting changes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I make improvements to my project?">
    Lovable provides multiple ways to update and refine your project:

    1. **Refine Components**: Adjust prompts for specific changes, e.g., "Make the header smaller."

    2. **Add Features**: Use prompts like “Add a user registration page.”

    3. **Select-to-Edit**: Click on specific components (e.g., button, section) to edit directly.

    4. **Version History**: Access previous versions to restore or compare changes.

  <Accordion title="How Does Lovable AI's Memory Work?">
    Lovable AI operates with a limited memory context, meaning it focuses on recent messages for optimal understanding. To ensure the best results when referencing older conversations, include any relevant context in your current message. This helps the AI provide accurate and coherent responses.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When does my monthly token count restock?">
    Your monthly token count **restocks on the same day you started your subscription** each month. It is not pro-rated to the 1st of the month but follows your **subscription anniversary date**.

    If you run out of tokens before your renewal date, you currently **cannot manually restart your plan early without upgrading**. This policy ensures that subscription tiers remain balanced while preventing unintended resets. If you anticipate needing more tokens regularly, consider adjusting your usage or upgrading to a higher plan that better fits your needs.

    For further flexibility options, feel free to share your feedback with our team!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can Lovable AI be used to build a complex B2B workflow-based SaaS app?">
    Yes, Lovable AI can help generate and structure complex B2B SaaS applications, including **workflow-driven systems** with multiple approval stages, role-based field visibility, document generation (with signatures and images), and customer-specific workflows.

    To build such an application, consider the following key aspects:

    1. **Database Design:** A well-structured data model is critical to managing profiles, approvals, and workflow logic effectively.

    2. **Role-Based Access & Visibility:** Define user roles with permission rules to control field visibility and data access at each stage.

    3. **Workflow Automation:** Use logic-based triggers to move work orders through different approval stages based on defined conditions.

    4. **Customizable Workflows:** Ensure flexibility so each customer can define unique workflow steps without breaking system integrity.

    5. **Document & Signature Management:** Integrate document generation, e-signatures, and media uploads within workflow approvals.

    While Lovable AI can assist in code generation and automation, the **real challenge lies in designing a scalable and maintainable system** that effectively translates business rules into functional workflows. If you have experience with similar implementations (e.g., Quote-to-Cash solutions), leveraging **Lovable AI for rapid prototyping** could be a great way to accelerate development.

    Let us know if you need guidance on specific aspects of building such a system!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Lovable with my own backend?">
    Absolutely! Lovable can generate code that connects to any backend. While connecting to most backends may require some technical knowledge, we’ve made it easy to use [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and its [native integration with Lovable](integrations/supabase).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I remove the Lovable badge from my app?">
    You can easily toggle the Lovable badge on or off directly from your project settings. Simply navigate to the project settings sidebar and adjust the "Show Lovable Badge" option for your deployed app.

    Even in free, the code you generate with Lovable AI fully belongs to you—you have full control over editing, using, and improving it. However, the watermark is a limitation of the free plan and is standard practice for many code generation and SaaS tools.

    While you are free to modify your generated code, **removing the Lovable watermark while on the free plan is not permitted**. If you prefer watermark-free outputs, consider upgrading to a paid plan, which allows you to generate and use code without any branding restrictions.

  <Accordion title="Why doesn’t Lovable AI use DeepSeekCoder V3?">
    We continuously evaluate different AI models, including DeepSeekCoder V3, to ensure we provide the best balance between **performance, accuracy, and cost-efficiency**. While DeepSeekCoder V3 is an interesting option, model selection depends on multiple factors:

    1. **Quality vs. Cost Tradeoff:** While it may reduce generation costs, we prioritize delivering high-quality and reliable code generation, ensuring minimal errors and better contextual understanding.

    2. **Scalability & Integration:** Any model we use must integrate seamlessly with our platform while maintaining speed and efficiency at scale.

    3. **Feature Compatibility:** Some models may lack advanced features or optimizations needed for our workflow and user needs.

    4. **User Benefit Considerations:** We are always exploring ways to **maximize token allocation** for users while maintaining top-tier AI capabilities.

    That said, we **actively test and benchmark new models** to improve the experience for our users.

    No, you can't at the moment. We recommend you to upgrade to a higher plan and then downgrade once you've used up your messages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does every message I send count towards my monthly limit?">
    Going forward, messages triggered by “Ask the AI to fix” won’t count toward your usage limits.

    All other messages—regardless of the outcome—will still count. We believe this will encourage us to improve “Ask the AI to fix” and at the same time makes it easier for you to use without worrying about usage limits.

    See [here](/user-guides/messaging-limits) for more information.

    Notice that this is different than the message count shown in the sidebar, which always increments for tracking purposes but does not reflect deductions from your credits when using “Ask the AI to fix.” If you notice any issues where credits are deducted incorrectly, please contact our support team so we can promptly resolve it.
  </Accordion>
