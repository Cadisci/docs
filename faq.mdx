## Can I download the code Lovable generates?

Yes, you can easily get access to the code generated by Lovable via our [GitHub integration](/integrations/git-integration).

## Can I use Lovable with my own backend?

Absolutely, Lovable can write code that can connect to any backend! While connecting Lovable requires some know-how for most backends, we have made it to use [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and its [native integration with Lovable](integrations/supabase).

## Can I import existing code from GitHub?

No, this isn't something we support at the moment.

## Does every message I send count towards my monthly limit?

Going forward, messages triggered by “Ask the AI to fix” won’t count toward your usage limits.

All other messages—regardless of the outcome—will still count.

We believe this will encourage us to improve “Ask the AI to fix” and at the same time makes it easier for you to use without worrying about usage limits.

See [here](/user-guides/messaging-limits) for more information.

## Can I top-up my monthly limit?

No, you can't at the moment. We recommend you to upgrade to a higher plan and then downgrade once you've used up your messages.

## Can Lovable build Mobile apps (iOS and Android)?

No, Lovable can only build web apps at the moment.

## Can Lovable write React Native/NextJS code?

No, Lovable can only generate applications based on Vite and React at the moment.

## Can I start from templates?

Yes, you can start from templates. You can browse them [here](https://lovable.dev/templates).

## Are you hiring?

[Yes](https://lovable.dev/careers) :)
