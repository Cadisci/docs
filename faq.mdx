## Can I download the code Lovable generates?

Yes, you can easily get access to the code generated by Lovable via our [GitHub integration](/integrations/git-integration).

## Can I use Lovable with my own backend?

Absolutely, Lovable can write code that can connect to any backend! If you don't have a backend yet, we recommend using [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and its [native integration with Lovable](integrations/supabase).

## Can I import existing code from GitHub?

No, this isn't something we support at the moment.

## Does every message I send count towards my monthly limit?

No, only successful messages count towards your monthly limit. If the code written fails to build, it does not count towards your monthly limit.

See [here](/user-guides/messaging-limits) for more information.

## Can I top-up my monthly limit?

No, you can't at the moment. We recommend you to upgrade to a higher plan and then downgrade once you've used up your messages.

## Can Lovable build Mobile apps (iOS and Android)?

No, Lovable can only build web apps at the moment.

## Can Lovable write React Native/NextJS code?

No, Lovable can only generate applications based on Vite and React at the moment.
