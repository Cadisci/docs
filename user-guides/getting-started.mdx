## Intro

Building products in Lovable broadly follows 3 steps:

1. Create a new project

2. Iterate it in the editor

3. Deploy it

Any deployed project can be iterated on and re-deployed.

We summarize each step below, but encourage you to invest some time into understanding the capabilities and limitations of Lovable to get optimal value out of it.

### 1) Create a project

To create a new project, login at`lovable.dev`&#x20;

There, you have several options for creating a new project:

1. Type a prompt into the chat (Text, visuals, or a combination) to start a project from scratch

2. Start from an existing template to further tailor and build on

3. Coming soon -- Connect to an existing codebase&#x20;

Once started, you can it is done, you will see a popup taking you to the editor where you can preview the site.

## Making improvements

To make improvements to your project, open the project editor and request a change in the chat.

<Note>
  The AI isn't perfect and will make mistakes. For example, it's common for it
  to write code with errors. Don't be alarmed by this. You can tell the AI to
  fix the errors and in the majority of cases it will fix them on its first
  attempt.
</Note>

Do you want to edit the code directly? You can access your project on Github and make [changes to the code yourself](/features/git-integration).

## Reverting changes

If you don't like the changes made by the AI and want to go back to a previous version, you can revert your project to any previous change. You can do so by clicking on the "Revert" button in the dropdown menu for edits.

## Deploying your project

Once you've made a project you're happy with, you can [deploy it](/features/deploy).
