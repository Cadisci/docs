## Module 1: Getting started with Lovable 101

By the end, youâ€™ll have a simple application up and running with authentication and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing notes.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Setting Up Supabase">
    Supabase is an open-source database service built on PostgreSQL. It provides authentication, data storage, and file storageâ€”perfect for our Lovable integration.

    1. **Create an Organization & Project**

       * Log into [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

       * Create an **organization** (name it based on your startup or project).

       * Create a **new project** within that organization.

       * Note your **Supabase URL** and **API key** (youâ€™ll need them later).

    2. **Configure Authentication**

       * Navigate to **Authentication > Sign In/Sign Up**.

       * Enable **Email authentication**.

       * Turn off **Confirm Email** (since we donâ€™t have an email provider set up yet).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Creating a Lovable Project">
    Now, letâ€™s set up a project in Lovable.

    1. **Start with a Fresh Blank Project**

       * Open Lovable and create a **new project**.

       * Keep your first prompt simple: *"Create a blank project"*.

       * Lovable will generate the basic structure for your app.

    2. **Connect Supabase to Lovable**

       * In Lovable, navigate to the **database settings**.

       * Enter your **Supabase project URL and API key**.

       * Click **Connect** to link your Lovable project to Supabase.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Adding a Login System">
    1. **Create a Navigation Bar with a Login Button**

       * Add a **nav bar** at the top of your project.

       * Include a **Login** button that redirects users to a login page.

    2. **Apply SQL Changes for Authentication**

       * Lovable will generate SQL for Supabase to handle authentication.

       * Click **Apply Changes** to execute the SQL commands.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Using the Visual Edit Tool">
    1. **Customize the UI**

       * Open the **Edit Tool** in Lovable.

       * Click on UI elements (e.g., buttons) to modify styles.

       * Ensure all text is visible (e.g., black text on white backgrounds).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Testing the Login System" defaultOpen={false}>
    1. **Create a Test Account**

       * Use the **Sign Up** form to create a new user.

       * Verify that login and logout workflows function correctly.

    2. **Redirect Users to a Dashboard After Login**

       * Modify the authentication flow to send users to a **dashboard** after login.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=" Adding Notes (CRUD Functionality)">
    1. **Set Up a Notes Table in Supabase**

       * Use Lovable to generate SQL for a **Notes** table.

       * Ensure it has **user ID** and **content** fields.

       * Click **Apply Changes** to create the table.

    2. **Build the Notes UI**

       * Add a **table to display notes** on the dashboard.

       * Include an **input field** and **buttons** for CRUD operations.

             <Info>
               CRUD create, read, update and delete
             </Info>

    3. **Test CRUD Operations**

       * Add a new note.

       * Edit an existing note.

       * Delete a note.

       * Verify notes persist in Supabase.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Debugging with Chat Mode">
    <Info>
      To enable [Chat Mode](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/labs), go to **Settings > Accounts Settings** tab.
    </Info>

    1. **Identify Errors**

       * If an issue arises, enable **Chat Mode**.

       * Lovable will analyze **Supabase logs** and **TypeScript errors**.

    2. **Apply Fixes**

       * Review Lovableâ€™s debugging suggestions.

       * Apply fixes as needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Congratulations ðŸŽ‰">
    Youâ€™ve:

    * Set up **Supabase** and **Lovable**.

    * Implemented **authentication**.

    * Built a **dashboard** with **CRUD functionality** for notes.

    * Learned how to debug issues effectively.
