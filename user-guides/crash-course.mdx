## Module 1: Getting started with Lovable 101

By the end, you‚Äôll have a simple application up and running with authentication and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing notes.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Setting Up Supabase">
    Supabase is an open-source database service built on PostgreSQL. It provides authentication, data storage, and file storage‚Äîperfect for our Lovable integration.

    1. **Create an Organization & Project**

       * Note your **Supabase URL** and **API key** (you‚Äôll need them later).

    2. **Configure Authentication**

       * Navigate to **Authentication > Sign In/Sign Up**.

       * Enable **Email authentication**.

       * Turn off **Confirm Email** (since we don‚Äôt have an email provider set up yet).

  <Accordion title="Congratulations üéâ">
    You‚Äôve:

    * Set up **Supabase** and **Lovable**.

    * Implemented **authentication**.

    * Built a **dashboard** with **CRUD functionality** for notes.

    * Learned how to debug issues effectively.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Module 2: Building Interactive UIs

In this module, we‚Äôll cover components, reusable UI elements, design improvements, and debugging best practices.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Understanding Components">
    Components in Lovable help organize UI elements into modular and reusable parts. Instead of having all UI elements in a single page (e.g., a 400-line dashboard), we break them into components such as:

    * **Sidebar**

    * **Welcome Card**

    * **Quote Card**

    * **Notes Section**

    This structure improves efficiency when making edits since changes apply only to specific components rather than the entire page.

    ### Creating and Using Components

    1. **Identify Large UI Sections** ‚Äì Look for UI parts that repeat or are too large.

    2. **Refactor Into Components** ‚Äì Use Lovable‚Äôs chat mode to scan the code and suggest an optimized structure.

    3. **Reuse Components** ‚Äì Copy and paste components across pages for consistency.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Editing UI Efficiently">
    1. **Modify Individual Components**

       * Instead of modifying the full dashboard, edit smaller components like the **Welcome Card**.

       * Run a prompt: *‚ÄúUpdate the copy in the Welcome Card to make it more engaging.‚Äù*

    2. **Use Chat Mode for Refactoring**

       * Ask Lovable to refactor large UI sections into smaller components.

       * Example: *‚ÄúRefactor the dashboard into smaller, cleaner components.‚Äù*
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enhancing UI with Pre-Built Components">
    If you‚Äôre not a designer, leveraging pre-built styles can improve your app‚Äôs appearance.

    1. **Using 21st.dev for UI Inspiration**

       * Visit [21st.dev](https://21st.dev/?tab=components\&sort=recommended) to explore pre-built UI components.

       * Choose a design, copy its prompt for Lovable, and integrate it into your project.

    2. **Creating Global Styles**

       * Modify an element on the project, for eg: *‚ÄúSet a button as Rainbow Button".*

       * Add this system prompt in the project settings' knowledge to ensure all new buttons follow this style: "When creating components, make sure to always use our global rainbow button".

       * Everytime you add a button, this pre-set style will be respected.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Redesigning the Dashboard">
    To update the dashboard layout:

    1. Find a **design you like** (e.g., on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/)).

    2. **Screenshot the relevant section** and upload it to Lovable.

    3. **Provide clear instructions**, such as:

       * *‚ÄúRefactor the dashboard layout based on this design.‚Äù*

       * *‚ÄúPlace notes in a left-hand sidebar, and open them in a side-by-side editable view.‚Äù*
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Implementing Real-Time Updates">
    1. **Enable Real-Time Sync for Notes**

       * Run a prompt: *‚ÄúEnable real-time updates for notes so that changes reflect instantly.‚Äù*

       * Ensure data updates in both the **sidebar** and **editing panel**.

    2. **Debugging UI Issues**

       * Use chat mode to scan the implementation and fix missing updates.

       * Example: *‚ÄúWhen editing the title in the side-by-side view, it doesn‚Äôt save. Fix this issue.‚Äù*
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Refining the Note Editing Experience">
    1. **Use** [**Mobbin**](https://mobbin.com/) **for Real-World UI Examples**

       * Search for ‚Äúnote-taking UI‚Äù to see how popular apps design their interfaces.

       * Example: A clean, minimalistic note editor with large titles and a dropdown for tags.

    2. **Applying UI Improvements**

       * Ensure the title is **large and prominent**.

       * Add **tags via a dropdown**, similar to the reference UI.

       * Example prompt: *‚ÄúRedesign the note editor to match this screenshot. Use a large title, white space for content, and dropdown-based tags.‚Äù*
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Debugging and Final Touches">
    1. **Fix UI Bugs**

       * Run a prompt: *‚ÄúFix the issue where note tags don‚Äôt save after editing.‚Äù*

       * Ensure all UI elements update correctly when modified.

    2. **Optimize Button Styling**

       * Adjust button and input styling to match the intended design.

       * Example: *‚ÄúEnsure all buttons use the global Rainbow Button style.‚Äù*
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Congratulations üéâ">
    By the end of this module, you should have:

    * Refactored large UI sections into reusable components.

    * Implemented a polished note-taking dashboard.

    * Used real-time updates for better user experience.

    * Refined the design using external inspirations and best practices.
