## Intro

Building products in Lovable broadly follows 3 steps:

1. Create a new project

2. Iterate it in the editor

3. Deploy it

Any deployed project can be iterated on and re-deployed.

We summarize each step below, but encourage you to invest some time into understanding the capabilities and limitations of Lovable to get optimal value out of it.

## 1) Create a project

To create a new project, login at`lovable.dev`&#x20;

***\[Add screenshot of Lovable starting page chatbox]***

There, you have several options for creating a new project:

1. Type a prompt into the chat (Text, visuals, or a combination) to start a project from scratch

2. Start from an existing template to further tailor and build on

3. Coming soon -- Connect to an existing codebase&#x20;

Once started, you will be redirected to the editor, where you can continue iterating on your project.

Note: If you are not logged in when creating a project, you will be directed to sign-up or log-in first.

## 2) Iterate your project

In the project editor, you can continue to develop your project.

To edit your project, you have two options:

1. Use prompts in the editor chat

2. Once connected to your Github repository, you can make direct commits in Github that will persist to the editor in real time. Commits are displayed in the editor chat.

###Reverting changes

***\[Add screenshot of Restore and Revert buttons editor UI]***

You may want to revert a change or restore a previous version if Lovable gets stuck - or if you simply don't like an edit that the AI made. Simply click on the "Revert" or "Restore" buttons in the chat, for the desired version.

## 3) Deploy your project

Once you've made a project you're happy with, you can [deploy it](/features/deploy).
