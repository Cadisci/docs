### Get Started&#x20;

There are several ways to get started with Lovable, depending on your preferences and resources:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Prompt">
    Lovable‚Äôs prompt-based system makes app creation simple.&#x20;

    * Just describe what you want to build in the prompt box.&#x20;

    * The more specific you are, the better the results.&#x20;

    * Start with clear and detailed prompts.&#x20;

    * You can refine and adjust your project as you go.&#x20;

    <Info>
      Example:&#x20;

      *"Create a dashboard with user login, monthly sales in a line chart, and customer demographics in a pie chart."*
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Templates">
    <Steps>

        Lovable offers [templates](https://lovable.dev/templates) to help you get started quickly on popular project types, such as dashboards, e-commerce sites, or social apps, for a quick setup.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Step 2">
        Once the template loads, use prompts to adjust features, add new elements, or fine-tune the design to match your vision.

    You can remix an existing public project or one of your own. Remixing allows you to reuse the current state of a project as a starting point and build upon it. It‚Äôs a great way to explore new ideas, make adjustments, or iterate with different changes while preserving the original version.&#x20;

    <Note>
      Note that it is not possible to remix projects when Supabase is connected.
    </Note>

### Module 2: Building Interactive UIs

In this module, we‚Äôll cover components, reusable UI elements, design improvements, and debugging best practices.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Understanding Components">
    Components in Lovable help organize UI elements into modular and reusable parts. Instead of having all UI elements in a single page (e.g., a 400-line dashboard), we break them into components such as:

    * **Sidebar**

    * **Welcome Card**

    * **Quote Card**

    * **Notes Section**

    This structure improves efficiency when making edits since changes apply only to specific components rather than the entire page.

    ### Creating and Using Components:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Identify Large UI Sections">
        Look for UI parts that repeat or are too large.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Refactor Into Components">
        Use Lovable‚Äôs chat mode to scan the code and suggest an optimized structure.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Reuse Components">
        Copy and paste components across pages for consistency.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Editing UI Efficiently">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Modify Individual Components">
        Instead of modifying the full dashboard, edit smaller components like the **Welcome Card**.

        <Info>
          Run a prompt:&#x20;

          *‚ÄúUpdate the copy in the Welcome Card to make it more engaging.‚Äù*
        </Info>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Use Chat Mode for Refactoring">
        Ask Lovable to refactor large UI sections into smaller components.

        <Info>
          Example:&#x20;

          *‚ÄúRefactor the dashboard into smaller, cleaner components.‚Äù*
        </Info>

        * Example: *‚ÄúRefactor the dashboard into smaller, cleaner components.‚Äù*
      </Step>

  <Accordion title="Enhancing UI with Pre-Built Components">
    If you‚Äôre not a designer, leveraging pre-built styles can improve your app‚Äôs appearance.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Using 21st.dev for UI Inspiration">
        <Steps>
          <Step title="Step 1">
            Visit [21st.dev](https://21st.dev/?tab=components\&sort=recommended) to explore pre-built UI components.
          </Step>

          <Step title="Step 2">
            Choose a design, copy its prompt for Lovable, and integrate it into your project.
          </Step>
        </Steps>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Creating Global Styles">
        <Steps>
          <Step title="Step 1">
            Modify an element on the project

            <Info>
              for eg: *‚ÄúSet a button as Rainbow Button".*
            </Info>
          </Step>

          <Step title="Step 2">
            Add this system prompt in the project settings' knowledge to ensure all new buttons follow this style:

            <Info>
              "When creating components, make sure to always use our global rainbow button".
            </Info>
          </Step>

          <Step title="Step 3">
            Everytime you add a button, this pre-set style will be respected.
          </Step>
        </Steps>
