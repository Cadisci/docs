Welcome to this step-by-step guide on how to create a full-stack application using Lovable. Each section is accompanied by a video to make things more visual.

### Creating your first project

To get started, head over to [lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev) and create an account.&#x20;

Once registered, you’ll be able to create your first project. Simply enter an initial prompt to kick things off, and Lovable will do the rest!

### Adding custom knowledge to your project

To ensure your application aligns with specific guidelines, you can add custom knowledge.&#x20;

For example, you might specify that Lovable should always create UI designs that are responsive and mobile-friendly. This helps tailor your project to meet your unique needs.

### Reverting a change

Made a mistake or didn’t get the result you wanted? No problem! Lovable allows you to undo changes quickly, giving you the freedom to experiment without worry.

### Using the Select feature

The **Select** tool is a game-changer. It lets you isolate specific parts of the UI that you want to modify, ensuring precision and flexibility in your design process.

### Adding images to your prompt

Visuals often speak louder than words. You can attach images directly to the chat to provide additional context for your prompts. This is particularly useful for illustrating ideas or concepts that are easier to show than describe.

### Adding images to your application

Want to add images directly to your application? Simply upload them in the chat and explain to Lovable’s AI where and how you’d like them to appear in your project.

### Connecting to GitHub

Integrate your project with GitHub to iterate on your application seamlessly. You can make code changes in GitHub or your preferred IDE while keeping everything in sync with Lovable.

### Publishing your project

When your project is ready, publish it to generate a shareable URL. This makes it easy to showcase your application or share it with collaborators and stakeholders.
