Welcome to this step-by-step guide on how to create a full-stack application using Lovable. Each section is accompanied by a video to make things more visual.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="➕ Create your first project">
    To get started, head over to [lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev) and create an account.&#x20;

    Once registered, you'll be able to create your first project. Simply enter an initial prompt to kick things off, and Lovable will do the rest!

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="🎬 Getting Started">
    There are several ways to get started with Lovable, depending on your preferences and resources:

    1. **Prompting:** Lovable’s prompt-based system makes app creation simple. Just describe what you want to build in the prompt box. The more specific you are, the better the results. Start with clear and detailed prompts. You can refine and adjust your project as you go. Example: *"Create a dashboard with user login, monthly sales in a line chart, and customer demographics in a pie chart."*

    2. **Templates:** Lovable offers [templates](https://lovable.dev/templates) to help you get started quickly on popular project types, such as dashboards, e-commerce sites, or social apps, for a quick setup. Once the template loads, use prompts to adjust features, add new elements, or fine-tune the design to match your vision.

    3. **Remix:** You can remix an existing public project or one of your own. Remixing allows you to reuse the current state of a project as a starting point and build upon it. It’s a great way to explore new ideas, make adjustments, or iterate with different changes while preserving the original version. Note that it is not possible to remix projects when Supabase is connected.

    4. **Using Figma:** If you have a design in Figma, take a screenshot of any part of it. You can paste the screenshot directly into Lovable or drag-and-drop the image file. Once you press Enter, Lovable will convert your design into functional code.

           <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c_qnRGzQUxA?si=21Eo16XgdqYply_y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen />

    5. **Sketching with** [**Excalidraw**](https://excalidraw.com/): Use Excalidraw or any similar tool to sketch your UI. Take a screenshot of your drawing, then paste or drag-and-drop it into Lovable. The platform will transform your sketch into working code.

           <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c0zhLzcVJRI?si=KeLfJuCYJ3boLvtV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen />

    6. **Cloning a Website or Application:** If you want to replicate an existing webpage, take a screenshot using shortcuts like *Cmd+Shift+4* on Mac or tools like the [GoFullPage Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gofullpage-full-page-scre/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl). Paste or drag the screenshot into Lovable, and it will recreate the structure of the webpage in your project.

    Each of these methods helps you kickstart your project with ease and flexibility.
