Welcome to this step-by-step guide on how to create a full-stack application using Lovable. Each section is accompanied by a video to make things more visual.

### Creating your first project

To get started, head over to [lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev) and create an account.&#x20;

Once registered, you’ll be able to create your first project. Simply enter an initial prompt to kick things off, and Lovable will do the rest!

### Adding custom knowledge to your project

The Knowledge Base in Lovable acts as your project's blueprint, where you define details like functionality, design elements, and goals. To set it up, create new entries in the **Knowledge Base** section of your dashboard, organizing them into categories such as Project Overview, Key Features, or Design Guidelines.

You can link these entries directly to your prompts, ensuring clarity, consistency, and alignment with your project requirements. The Knowledge Base also serves as a collaborative tool for teams, streamlining communication and keeping everyone aligned.

Regularly update your entries as your project evolves to maintain relevance and ensure your app development stays on track.

### Reverting a change

Lovable offers intuitive editing tools and undo functionality, giving you the freedom to experiment without worry. You can make direct edits, use prompts for adjustments, or leverage the Select tool for precise changes. If a change doesn’t work out, use the **Undo** button to reverse your actions, or explore the **Version History** to restore earlier versions of your project.

To test edits, use the **Preview** mode to see real-time changes and easily revert them if needed. For effective editing, make incremental changes, save major updates using versioning, and document key changes for team alignment. Lovable ensures a seamless editing experience, empowering you to refine your projects with confidence.

### Adding images to your prompt

Visuals often speak louder than words. You can attach images directly to the chat to provide additional context for your prompts. This is particularly useful for illustrating ideas or concepts that are easier to show than describe.

### Adding images to your application

Want to add images directly to your application? Simply upload them in the chat and explain to Lovable’s AI where and how you’d like them to appear in your project.

### Connecting to GitHub

Integrate your project with GitHub to iterate on your application seamlessly. You can make code changes in GitHub or your preferred IDE while keeping everything in sync with Lovable.

### Publishing your project

When your project is ready, publish it to generate a shareable URL. This makes it easy to showcase your application or share it with collaborators and stakeholders.
