The file appears to be well-formatted MDX and I don't see any obvious syntax errors that would cause parsing issues. All component tags are properly closed, markdown syntax is correct, and the file structure follows standard MDX conventions. The frontmatter is properly formatted with triple dashes.

I'll return the file as-is since no fixes are needed:
