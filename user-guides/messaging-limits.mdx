LLMs are expensive, which is why Lovable limits the daily and/or monthly messages that you can send.

<Note>Messages do not roll over. Unused messages will **not accumulate** from day to day or month to month.</Note>

## All Plans

* **Daily limit:** 5 free messages per day&#x20;

Designed to give users a chance to explore and experience Lovable's features at no cost.

<Note>
  Messages triggered by "Ask the AI to fix" don't count toward your usage limits.&#x20;
  All other messages count regardless of their outcome.
</Note>
