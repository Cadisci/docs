description: "Understanding daily and monthly message limits for Lovable"
---

LLMs are expensive, which is why Lovable limits the daily and/or monthly messages that you can send.

<Note>Messages do not roll over. Unused messages will **not accumulate** from day to day or month to month.</Note>

## All Plans

* **Daily limit:** 5 free messages per day&#x20;

Designed to give users a chance to explore and experience Lovable's features at no cost.

<Note>
  Messages triggered by "Ask the AI to fix" don't count toward your usage limits.&#x20;
  All other messages count regardless of their outcome.
</Note>

## Free Plan

* **5 free messages per day**

* Maximum of **50 messages per month**

## Available Paid Plans

For detailed information about subscription options, visit our [subscription page](#).

Each paid plan includes a set number of allocated messages, in addition to the **5 free messages per day** provided to all users.

For eg., as of **2024-11-11**, the **Starter Plan** allows for a monthly limit of **100 messages** across user projects. This means you receive:

* **100 messages** from the paid plan

* Plus approximately **150 messages** (5 free messages/day Ã— 30 days)

**Total: \~250 messages per month**

## Upgrading and Downgrading Plans

### Upgrading

When upgrading your plan, the cost is calculated based on the time remaining in the current billing period. This means:&#x20;

* **X**: The amount already paid during this billing period.

* **Y**: The cost of the new plan.

* **A**: Total days in the billing month.

* **B**: Days that have already passed in the current billing month.

The cost of upgrading (invoiced immediately) is:` (Y - X) * (B / A)`

### Downgrading

When downgrading your plan:

* **No immediate changes** occur to your subscription.

* The downgrade will take effect at the **start of the next billing period**, at which point you will be billed for the new, lower-cost plan.
