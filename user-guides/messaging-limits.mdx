LLMs are expensive, which is why Lovable limits the daily and/or monthly messages that you can send.

<Note>Daily message limits renew at midnight UTC.</Note>

## All Plans

* **Daily limit:** 5 free messages per day

Designed to give users a chance to explore and experience Lovable's features at no cost.

<Note>
  Messages triggered by “Ask the AI to fix” won’t count toward your usage limits.&#x20;
  All other messages—regardless of the outcome—will still count.
</Note>
