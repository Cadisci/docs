---

LLMs are expensive, which is why Lovable limits the daily and/or monthly messages that you can send.

<Note>Messages do not roll over. Unused messages will **not accumulate** from day to day or month to month.</Note>

## All Plans

* **Daily limit:** 5 free messages per day

Designed to give users a chance to explore and experience Lovable's features at no cost.

<Note>
  Messages triggered by "Ask the AI to fix" don't count toward your usage limits.&#x20;
  All other messages count regardless of their outcome.
</Note>

## Free Plan

* 5 free messages per day
* Maximum of 30 messages per month

## Available Paid Plans

Each paid plan includes a set number of allocated messages, plus 5 free daily messages available to all users.

## Upgrading and Downgrading Plans

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upgrading">
    When upgrading your plan, the cost is adjusted based on the time left in your current billing cycle. You’ll only pay the difference between what you’ve already paid and the cost of the new plan for the remaining days in the billing period. This amount will be charged immediately.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Downgrading">
    <b>When downgrading your plan:</b>

    <ul>
      <li><b>No immediate changes</b> occur to your subscription.</li>
      <li>The downgrade will take effect at the <b>start of the next billing period</b>, at which point you will be billed for the new, lower-cost plan.</li>
    </ul>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Legacy Plans">
    Some early access users are "grandfathered" on their existing plans, but can choose to move to the new plans before the old ("pro") plan is officially deprecated.
  </Accordion>

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pricing Changes or Charges">
    Lovable sends community and email notifications about any upcoming pricing changes. Please ensure your email is up-to-date in your account settings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Errors During Payment Setup">
    Occasionally, payment setups may fail due to issues with Stripe. If this occurs, double-check your payment details and retry. If problems persist, contact our support team for assistance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Change payment cards">
    You can update your payment method anytime by navigating to **Account Settings > Plans & Billing** and managing your details through Stripe.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Paid Users Losing Access">
    This typically happens due to billing issues (e.g., expired cards). Ensure your payment method is valid to avoid interruptions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Resolving Overages or Refunds">
    If you experience message overages or require a refund, reach out to our support team. We handle these on a case-by-case basis to ensure a fair resolution.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Chat Mode credits consumption">
    We launched **Chat Mode** as a **Labs feature** (accessible: Account > Settings > Labs)\*\* a couple of weeks ago and have gotten very good feedback from early testers. We have now started to extend its capabilities, and it's starting to feel like talking to a seasoned CTO who knows your projects and goals inside and out.

    <Note>
      Because these capabilities come with additional costs, messages in Chat Mode will now start counting towards your message limit.
