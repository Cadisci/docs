---

LLMs are expensive, which is why Lovable limits the daily and/or monthly messages that you can send.

<Note>Daily message limits renew at midnight UTC.</Note>

## All Plans

- **Daily limit:** 5 free messages per day

Designed to give users a chance to explore and experience Lovable's features at no cost.

<Note>
  **What happens if my edit fails?** If a message results in a failed code
  change (build error), we will refund that message, and your message limits
  will **not** be affected.
</Note>
