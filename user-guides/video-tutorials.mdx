    In this tutorial, we'll walk you through creating an AI-powered calorie tracking app, complete with authentication, a beautiful responsive design, OpenAI integration, and deployment to production.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Setting Up the Foundation">
        The foundation of any Lovable project is a good prompt. For this app, here’s an example:

        ```
        Create a calorie tracking app with the following features:
        Landing page, dashboard, and a meals page.
        Input fields for meal descriptions or images, with analysis powered by GPT-4.
        Daily progress tracking and integration with Supabase for authentication and database management.
        Beautiful and mobile-responsive UI.
        ```

        Once Lovable generates the UI skeleton:

        * Review the navigation setup and landing page design.

        * Iterate on the prompt to refine the layout and ensure mobile responsiveness.

        <Note>
          Be explicit about starting with the UI. Lovable works best when tasks are broken into clear steps. For instance, outline navigation, page structures, and design themes early in the prompt
        </Note>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Designing the UI">
        Lovable emphasizes a step-by-step approach, akin to constructing a building:

        * Start with **scaffolding**: Plan your app structure (e.g., user experience flow, page layout).

        * Add the **first layer**: Create empty pages with basic design elements.

        * Refine the **details**: Add colors, animations, and mobile responsiveness.

        <Note>
          If you have pre-made designs in [Figma](), you can take screenshots and include them in your Lovable prompt. Providing high-resolution images ensures better results.
        </Note>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Integrate Supabase for Backend and Authentication">
        Once the UI is ready, it’s time to add backend functionality:

        1. Set up a [**Supabase**]() **account** and create a project.

        2. Link it to Lovable by pressing the "Connect Supabase" button.

        3. For data storage, Lovable will generate SQL tables. For instance:

        * A `profiles` table to store user information.

        * A `meals` table linked to users for tracking daily entries.

        <Info>
          Use row-level security (RLS) rules in Supabase to ensure user privacy. Lovable can handle this for you automatically.
        </Info>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Integrating OpenAI for Meal Analysis">
        The magic of this app lies in its AI capabilities. To analyze meals:

        1. Obtain an [OpenAI API key]() from your developer dashboard.

        2. Use [GPT-4]() for analyzing meal descriptions or images.

        3. Ensure API keys are securely stored in Edge functions to prevent unauthorized access.

        **Features to include:**

        * **Analyze meal descriptions**: Estimate nutritional values (calories, protein, carbs, fat).

        * **Image recognition**: Upload a meal photo, and GPT-4 will extract a description and nutritional data.

        <Info>
          *Pro Tips for OpenAI Integration:*

          * Use **function calling** for structured responses, ensuring data is formatted correctly for database insertion.

          * Test the functionality by asking the app to analyze simple meal entries like “2 eggs.”
        </Info>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Implementing Payments with Stripe">
        To monetize the app, add subscription-based payments:

        1. Create a [Stripe]() account and set up a product (e.g., “Standard Plan” for $12/month).

        2. Integrate Stripe with Lovable by adding the API key and product price ID.

        3. Redirect non-paying users to the landing page. Only paying users can access the main app.

        <Info>
          *Additional Tips:*

          * Enable Stripe’s **customer portal** to let users manage subscriptions (e.g., cancel or update payment methods).

          * Test payments in Stripe’s test mode using the provided test credit card details.
        </Info>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Testing and Debugging">
        Errors are a natural part of development, and Lovable simplifies debugging:

        * Use the **"Try to Fix"** button whenever a build error occurs.

        * For backend issues, check Supabase logs for detailed error reports.

        * If deploying to [Netlify](), review deployment logs for any build issues. Share logs with Lovable to get tailored fixes.

        <Info>
          &#x20;If you get stuck, revert to a previous version using Lovable’s "Revert" feature. This saves credits and time.
        </Info>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Deploying Your App">
        Once your app is ready, deploy it with Lovable or Netlify:

        1. Use Lovable’s deploy feature to host the app on a default domain.

        2. For custom domains:

        * Connect your [GitHub repository]() to Netlify.

        * Purchase a domain and configure [DNS settings]() to link it to Netlify.

        <Info>
          Update your app’s metadata (favicon, meta tags, OG image) for better branding and SEO.
        </Info>

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Start with Inspiration">
        Every project starts with a clear vision. For this MVP, the client wanted an **AI-powered dashboard**.

        To kickstart the design process:

        * Took a screenshot of a relevant landing page.

        * Asked [**ChatGPT**]() to describe the design in detail—layout, sections, colors, and typography.

        * Used this breakdown as the **foundation for building in Lovable**

        * **Set up payment workflows** for different plans.

        * **Tested transactions** for reliability.

        * **Synced Stripe dashboards** for client visibility.
