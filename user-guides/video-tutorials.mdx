    <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c0zhLzcVJRI?si=6JJk5SHk3VnMroCN" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen />

    In this tutorial, we'll walk you through creating an AI-powered calorie tracking app, complete with authentication, a beautiful responsive design, OpenAI integration, and deployment to production.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Setting Up the Foundation">
        The foundation of any Lovable project is a good prompt. For this app, here’s an example:

        ```
        Create a calorie tracking app with the following features:
        Landing page, dashboard, and a meals page.
        Input fields for meal descriptions or images, with analysis powered by GPT-4.
        Daily progress tracking and integration with Supabase for authentication and database management.
        Beautiful and mobile-responsive UI.
        ```

        Once Lovable generates the UI skeleton:

        * Review the navigation setup and landing page design.

        * Iterate on the prompt to refine the layout and ensure mobile responsiveness.

        <Note>
          Be explicit about starting with the UI. Lovable works best when tasks are broken into clear steps. For instance, outline navigation, page structures, and design themes early in the prompt
        </Note>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Designing the UI">
        Lovable emphasizes a step-by-step approach, akin to constructing a building:

        * Start with **scaffolding**: Plan your app structure (e.g., user experience flow, page layout).

        * Add the **first layer**: Create empty pages with basic design elements.

        * Refine the **details**: Add colors, animations, and mobile responsiveness.

        <Note>
          If you have pre-made designs in [Figma](), you can take screenshots and include them in your Lovable prompt. Providing high-resolution images ensures better results.
        </Note>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Integrate Supabase for Backend and Authentication">
        Once the UI is ready, it’s time to add backend functionality:

        1. Set up a [**Supabase**]() **account** and create a project.

        2. Link it to Lovable by pressing the "Connect Supabase" button.

        3. For data storage, Lovable will generate SQL tables. For instance:

        * A `profiles` table to store user information.

        * A `meals` table linked to users for tracking daily entries.

        <Info>
          Use row-level security (RLS) rules in Supabase to ensure user privacy. Lovable can handle this for you automatically.
        </Info>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Integrating OpenAI for Meal Analysis">
        The magic of this app lies in its AI capabilities. To analyze meals:

        1. Obtain an [OpenAI API key]() from your developer dashboard.

        2. Use [GPT-4]() for analyzing meal descriptions or images.

        3. Ensure API keys are securely stored in Edge functions to prevent unauthorized access.

        **Features to include:**

        * **Analyze meal descriptions**: Estimate nutritional values (calories, protein, carbs, fat).

        * **Image recognition**: Upload a meal photo, and GPT-4 will extract a description and nutritional data.

        <Info>
          *Pro Tips for OpenAI Integration:*

          * Use **function calling** for structured responses, ensuring data is formatted correctly for database insertion.

          * Test the functionality by asking the app to analyze simple meal entries like “2 eggs.”
        </Info>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Implementing Payments with Stripe">
        To monetize the app, add subscription-based payments:

        1. Create a [Stripe]() account and set up a product (e.g., “Standard Plan” for $12/month).

        2. Integrate Stripe with Lovable by adding the API key and product price ID.

        3. Redirect non-paying users to the landing page. Only paying users can access the main app.

        <Info>
          *Additional Tips:*

          * Enable Stripe’s **customer portal** to let users manage subscriptions (e.g., cancel or update payment methods).

          * Test payments in Stripe’s test mode using the provided test credit card details.
        </Info>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Testing and Debugging">
        Errors are a natural part of development, and Lovable simplifies debugging:

        * Use the **"Try to Fix"** button whenever a build error occurs.

        * For backend issues, check Supabase logs for detailed error reports.

        * If deploying to [Netlify](), review deployment logs for any build issues. Share logs with Lovable to get tailored fixes.

        <Info>
          &#x20;If you get stuck, revert to a previous version using Lovable’s "Revert" feature. This saves credits and time.
        </Info>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Deploying Your App">
        Once your app is ready, deploy it with Lovable or Netlify:

        1. Use Lovable’s deploy feature to host the app on a default domain.

        2. For custom domains:

        * Connect your [GitHub repository]() to Netlify.

        * Purchase a domain and configure [DNS settings]() to link it to Netlify.

        <Info>
          Update your app’s metadata (favicon, meta tags, OG image) for better branding and SEO.

    In this tutorial, we'll walk through creating a simple yet powerful CRM using Lovable for development, Supabase for data storage, and Resend for email automation. By the end, you'll have a system that collects leads, stores them securely, and allows you to send follow-up emails—all built in less than an hour.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Setting Up the Contact Form in Lovable">
        The first step is to create a landing page with a contact form where users can submit their details.

        ### Instructions:

        1. Open Lovable and create a new project.

        2. Use the AI assistant to generate a simple landing page by prompting: *"Create a SaaS landing page with a contact form collecting name, email, and message."*

        3. Add form validation to ensure proper data entry.

        At this stage, your landing page should include a form that users can fill out. However, we need to store this data somewhere, which leads us to Supabase.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Connecting Supabase for Data Storage">
        Supabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase, offering a secure and scalable database for your CRM.

        ### Instructions:

        1. Create a **Supabase** account and start a new project.

        2. In Lovable, connect your Supabase project by adding the **API key**.

        3. Create a database table named `contacts` with columns:

           * `id` (UUID, primary key)

           * `name` (text)

           * `email` (text)

           * `message` (text)

           * `created_at` (timestamp)

        4. Modify the contact form to send form data to Supabase upon submission.

        With this setup, user submissions will be stored securely in Supabase, and we can move on to automating email notifications.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Automating Emails with Resend">
        [Resend]() ensures that every new contact receives a confirmation email while allowing us to send follow-up messages later.

      </Step>

      <Step title="Creating an Admin Dashboard">
        To manage leads efficiently, we need an admin dashboard where authenticated users can view and respond to contacts.

        ### Instructions:

        1. Create an **admin route** in Lovable.

        2. Implement **authentication** with Supabase (email/password login).

        3. Display stored contacts in a **table format** with the following:

           * Contact Name

           * Email

           * Message Preview

           * Date Submitted

        4. Add a **detailed view** panel where clicking on a contact reveals full details.

        Now, only logged-in users can view and manage CRM data.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Sending Personalized Emails from the Admin Dashboard">
        To streamline communication, we'll add the ability to send custom follow-up emails directly from the admin dashboard.

        ### Instructions:

        1. Add a **text field** and predefined templates (e.g., "Thank you for signing up!" or "Follow-up on your request").

        2. Implement a **send button** that triggers an email using Resend.

        3. Log sent emails in Supabase for future reference.

        Once implemented, you can send quick, personalized emails without leaving the CRM.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Adding a Newsletter Subscription Feature">
        A great way to nurture leads is by sending updates via a newsletter. We'll add a subscription form to capture emails.

        ### Instructions:

        1. Add a **newsletter signup form** to the landing page.

        2. Connect the form to **Resend Audiences** to store subscribers.

        3. Set up a simple **broadcast email campaign** to engage subscribers.

        Now, you can send newsletters to all subscribers directly from Resend.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Congratulations 🎉 ">

        We aimed for a short, memorable name that reflected the **learning journey**. Using AI, we brainstormed and landed on **Ruta** (Spanish for “route” or “path”).

        #### **Process:**

        * **Brainstormed names** using AI for catchy Spanish words.

        * **Tested options** like "Camino" and "Verbo," but "Ruta" stood out.

        * **Checked domain availability** and secured **rutaapp.com** immediately.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Creating a Visual Identity">
        We quickly designed the brand:

        * **Logo**: A **compass-themed** icon sourced from design libraries and edited in Figma.

        * **Font Pairing**: Used a **bold, modern typeface** for the logo and a readable UI font for the app interface.

        * **Color Palette**: A **Tailwind CSS blue** scheme to symbolize travel and discovery.

        * **Styling Inspiration**: Experimented with **neo-brutalism**, tweaking contrast, shadows, and borders to create a visually engaging UI.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Building a Cohesive User Experience">
        Using Lovable, we ensured **visual consistency** across the app:

        * **Landing Page**: AI-generated with a dynamic, engaging hero section.

        * **Dashboard & Course Pages**: Styled to match the brand’s identity.

        * **Iterative Styling**: Applied **neo-brutalist** elements to test different design styles.

        * **User Flow Testing**: Ensured seamless navigation from signup to real-time chat.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Start with Inspiration">
        Every project starts with a clear vision. For this MVP, the client wanted an **AI-powered dashboard**.

        To kickstart the design process:

        * Took a screenshot of a relevant landing page.

        * Asked [**ChatGPT**]() to describe the design in detail—layout, sections, colors, and typography.

        * Used this breakdown as the **foundation for building in Lovable**

        <Info>
          *Describe this landing page in detail, including layout, sections, colors, and typography.*
        </Info>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Build the Core with Lovable">
        Once the blueprint was ready, Lovable handled the **entire foundation of the app**.
      </Step>

      <Step title="GitHub Integration">
        Lovable **automatically creates a** [**GitHub repository**]() for your project, syncing updates effortlessly. **Workflow:**

        <Steps>
          <Step title="Generate a repo in Lovable." />

          <Step title="Transfer it to your GitHub account." />

          <Step title="Clone it into Cursor for advanced coding." />
        </Steps>

        This keeps everything organized and **developer-friendly** when custom logic is required.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Supabase for Authentication & Database">
        With Supabase integration, setting up the backend was a breeze.

        * **Added authentication** for user signups/logins.

        * **Set up a database** to manage profiles and app data.

        * **Connected APIs** without writing redundant boilerplate code.

        <Info>
          *Add Supabase authentication to the app, allowing users to sign up and log in using their email.*
        </Info>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Email Automation with Resend">
        To ensure smooth communication, Lovable’s [**Resend integration**]() handled transactional emails.

        * **Welcome emails** for new users.

        * **Action-triggered notifications** within the app.

        <Info>
          *Set up an email workflow using Resend that sends a welcome email to users upon signup and a notification when they complete an action.*
        </Info>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Chat with Your Codebase">
        Lovable’s built-in **chat feature** makes managing large projects effortless.

        * Quickly reference task breakdowns.&#x20;

        * Get a high-level project overview instantly.

        <Info>
          *Based on the PRD and task breakdown, list all completed features and highlight pending tasks.*
        </Info>

        This feature **saves hours** by keeping teams aligned on progress.
      </Step>

      <Step title="OpenAI for AI-Powered Features">
        The app needed AI-driven data summarization.

        * **Lovable’s** [**OpenAI integration**]() made API setup seamless.&#x20;

        * AI functionality was up and running in **minutes**.

        <Info>
          *Integrate OpenAI APIs to summarize user data input and display the results on the dashboard.*
        </Info>
      </Step>

      <Step title="AI Image Generation with Replicate">
        For AI-powered visuals, **Replicate integration** allowed users to generate images dynamically.

        * Enabled **custom AI-generated visuals** inside the app.

        * Required minimal configuration.

        <Info>
          *Add Replicate integration to generate AI-powered images based on user inputs.*
        </Info>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Payments with Stripe">
        Handling **subscriptions and transactions** was effortless with Stripe integration.

        * **Set up payment workflows** for different plans.

        * **Tested transactions** for reliability.

        * **Synced Stripe dashboards** for client visibility.

        <Info>
          *Integrate Stripe into the app to allow subscription payments, including a dashboard for users to manage their plans*.
        </Info>
      </Step>

      <Step title="From Lovable to Cursor for Finalization">
        Once the app was functional, it was **synced to GitHub and imported into** [**Cursor**]() for:&#x20;

        * **UI refinements**

        * **Advanced backend logic**

        * **Final debugging & optimisations**

        Cursor provided a **developer-friendly environment** to polish the project before deployment.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    This streamlined workflow—**ChatGPT for planning, Lovable for building, and Cursor for refining**—significantly **reduces MVP development time**.
