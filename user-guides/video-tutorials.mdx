  <Accordion title="Build an AI-Powered Calorie Tracking WebApp">
    <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c0zhLzcVJRI?si=6JJk5SHk3VnMroCN" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen />

    In this tutorial, we'll walk you through creating an AI-powered calorie tracking app, complete with authentication, a beautiful responsive design, OpenAI integration, and deployment to production.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Setting Up the Foundation">
        The foundation of any Lovable project is a good prompt. For this app, here’s an example:

        ```
        Create a calorie tracking app with the following features:
        Landing page, dashboard, and a meals page.
        Input fields for meal descriptions or images, with analysis powered by GPT-4.
        Daily progress tracking and integration with Supabase for authentication and database management.
        Beautiful and mobile-responsive UI.
        ```

        Once Lovable generates the UI skeleton:

        - Review the navigation setup and landing page design.
        - Iterate on the prompt to refine the layout and ensure mobile responsiveness.

        <Note>
          Be explicit about starting with the UI. Lovable works best when tasks are broken into clear steps. For instance, outline navigation, page structures, and design themes early in the prompt
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Designing the UI">
        Lovable emphasizes a step-by-step approach, akin to constructing a building:

        - Start with **scaffolding**: Plan your app structure (e.g., user experience flow, page layout).
        - Add the **first layer**: Create empty pages with basic design elements.
        - Refine the **details**: Add colors, animations, and mobile responsiveness.

        <Note>
          If you have pre-made designs in [Figma](), you can take screenshots and include them in your Lovable prompt. Providing high-resolution images ensures better results.
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Integrate Supabase for Backend and Authentication">
        Once the UI is ready, it’s time to add backend functionality:

        1. Set up a [**Supabase**]() **account** and create a project.
        2. Link it to Lovable by pressing the "Connect Supabase" button.
        3. For data storage, Lovable will generate SQL tables. For instance:

        - A `profiles` table to store user information.
        - A `meals` table linked to users for tracking daily entries.

        <Note>
          Use row-level security (RLS) rules in Supabase to ensure user privacy. Lovable can handle this for you automatically.
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Integrating OpenAI for Meal Analysis">
        The magic of this app lies in its AI capabilities. To analyze meals:

        1. Obtain an [OpenAI API key]() from your developer dashboard.
        2. Use [GPT-4]() for analyzing meal descriptions or images.
        3. Ensure API keys are securely stored in Edge functions to prevent unauthorized access.

        **Features to include:**

        - **Analyze meal descriptions**: Estimate nutritional values (calories, protein, carbs, fat).
        - **Image recognition**: Upload a meal photo, and GPT-4 will extract a description and nutritional data.

        <Note>
          _Pro Tips for OpenAI Integration:_

          - Use **function calling** for structured responses, ensuring data is formatted correctly for database insertion.
          - Test the functionality by asking the app to analyze simple meal entries like “2 eggs.”
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Implementing Payments with Stripe">
        To monetize the app, add subscription-based payments:

        1. Create a [Stripe]() account and set up a product (e.g., “Standard Plan” for $12/month).
        2. Integrate Stripe with Lovable by adding the API key and product price ID.
        3. Redirect non-paying users to the landing page. Only paying users can access the main app.

        <Note>
          _Additional Tips:_

          - Enable Stripe’s **customer portal** to let users manage subscriptions (e.g., cancel or update payment methods).
          - Test payments in Stripe’s test mode using the provided test credit card details.
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Testing and Debugging">
        Errors are a natural part of development, and Lovable simplifies debugging:

        - Use the **"Try to Fix"** button whenever a build error occurs.
        - For backend issues, check Supabase logs for detailed error reports.
        - If deploying to [Netlify](), review deployment logs for any build issues. Share logs with Lovable to get tailored fixes.

        <Note>
          If you get stuck, revert to a previous version using Lovable’s "Revert" feature. This saves credits and time.
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Deploying Your App">
        Once your app is ready, deploy it with Lovable or Netlify:

        1. Use Lovable’s deploy feature to host the app on a default domain.
        2. For custom domains:

        - Connect your [GitHub repository]() to Netlify.
        - Purchase a domain and configure [DNS settings]() to link it to Netlify.

        <Note>
          Update your app’s metadata (favicon, meta tags, OG image) for better branding and SEO.
        </Note>

    In this tutorial, we'll walk through creating a simple yet powerful CRM using Lovable for development, Supabase for data storage, and Resend for email automation. By the end, you'll have a system that collects leads, stores them securely, and allows you to send follow-up emails—all built in less than an hour.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Setting Up the Contact Form in Lovable">
        The first step is to create a landing page with a contact form where users can submit their details.

        ### Instructions:

        1. Open Lovable and create a new project.
        2. Use the AI assistant to generate a simple landing page by prompting: _"Create a SaaS landing page with a contact form collecting name, email, and message."_
        3. Add form validation to ensure proper data entry.

        At this stage, your landing page should include a form that users can fill out. However, we need to store this data somewhere, which leads us to Supabase.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Connecting Supabase for Data Storage">
        Supabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase, offering a secure and scalable database for your CRM.

        ### Instructions:

        1. Create a **Supabase** account and start a new project.
        2. In Lovable, connect your Supabase project by adding the **API key**.
        3. Create a database table named `contacts` with columns:
           - `id` (UUID, primary key)
           - `name` (text)
           - `email` (text)
           - `message` (text)
           - `created_at` (timestamp)
        4. Modify the contact form to send form data to Supabase upon submission.

        With this setup, user submissions will be stored securely in Supabase, and we can move on to automating email notifications.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Automating Emails with Resend">
        [Resend]() ensures that every new contact receives a confirmation email while allowing us to send follow-up messages later.

        ### Instructions:

        1. Create a **Resend** account.
        2. Verify your domain to improve email deliverability.
        3. Generate an **API key** and integrate it into Lovable.
        4. Modify the submission function to trigger an email confirmation using Resend.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Creating an Admin Dashboard">
        To manage leads efficiently, we need an admin dashboard where authenticated users can view and respond to contacts.

        ### Instructions:

        1. Create an **admin route** in Lovable.
        2. Implement **authentication** with Supabase (email/password login).
        3. Display stored contacts in a **table format** with the following:
           - Contact Name
           - Email
           - Message Preview
           - Date Submitted
        4. Add a **detailed view** panel where clicking on a contact reveals full details.

        Now, only logged-in users can view and manage CRM data.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Sending Personalized Emails from the Admin Dashboard">
        To streamline communication, we'll add the ability to send custom follow-up emails directly from the admin dashboard.

        ### Instructions:

        1. Add a **text field** and predefined templates (e.g., "Thank you for signing up!" or "Follow-up on your request").
        2. Implement a **send button** that triggers an email using Resend.
        3. Log sent emails in Supabase for future reference.

        Once implemented, you can send quick, personalized emails without leaving the CRM.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Adding a Newsletter Subscription Feature">
        A great way to nurture leads is by sending updates via a newsletter. We'll add a subscription form to capture emails.

        ### Instructions:

        1. Add a **newsletter signup form** to the landing page.
        2. Connect the form to **Resend Audiences** to store subscribers.
        3. Set up a simple **broadcast email campaign** to engage subscribers.

        Now, you can send newsletters to all subscribers directly from Resend.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Congratulations 🎉 ">
        You’ve successfully built a simple CRM that collects leads, sends confirmation emails, allows for admin management, and enables direct email outreach—all in under an hour.

        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Creating Dynamic Backgrounds and Animations">
        Lovable now supports seamless integration of animated and interactive elements using **p5.js** and other libraries.

        #### **Example Project: Travel Agency Website with Interactive Flags**

        A recent live demo showcased how to build a travel agency landing page featuring:

        1. **An animated hero section** with flags dynamically appearing and moving in response to mouse interactions.
        2. **A sticky-scroll section** that changes based on the user’s scroll position.
        3. **Interactive hover effects** where images react to user movements.

        #### **How to Implement Animated Effects**

        To create these effects, users followed this simple process:

        - **Define the desired animation:**

        <Note>
          Make the background interactive with floating elements that move away when hovered over.
        </Note>
        - **Use p5.js to generate effects:**
          - Implement a chromatic smoke pattern.
          - Swap out static images for dynamic flag animations.
        - **Enhance user experience with physics-based interactions:**
          - Make elements move dynamically based on user actions.

        <Note>
          If an animation isn’t working, use Lovable’s chat mode to debug and refine the effect with step-by-step AI guidance.
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Importing Custom Elements from External Libraries">
        With [**21st.dev**](), users can now integrate pre-built UI components seamlessly into Lovable projects.

        1. Browse **21st.dev** for a button design.
        2. Copy the AI-generated prompt.
        3. Paste it into Lovable and replace an existing button.

        This approach accelerates design workflows and allows for more polished, visually cohesive interfaces.

        <Note>
          This same method works for importing animation presets from **motion.dev**, making it easier to add high-quality motion effects without custom coding.
        </Note>

## Build, Brand, and Launch a real micro-SaaS, live!

Learning Spanish has never been this interactive! Imagine an app that not only teaches you Spanish through conversations but also creates real-time voice interactions, dynamic courses, and visually engaging content—powered entirely by AI. This tutorial can help follow step-by-step what Kristian and Harry built:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Step 1: Designing the Core Features">
    <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8QDL9cCIXqU?si=JPHSSBoWO4dXl7vB" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen />

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Laying the Foundations">
        Before implementing AI features, we focused on **building a strong foundation** for the app using **Lovable**. This included setting up authentication, structuring the dashboard, and implementing user management.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Authentication System">
        - Integrated **Supabase** for backend authentication.
        - Enabled sign-up/login with email and password.
        - Created a profile system to store user preferences and learning progress.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Dashboard & Navigation">
        - Designed an intuitive sidebar for navigation.
        - Created sections for chat, courses, and user settings.
        - Ensured responsive UI for a seamless experience across devices.
      </Step>
      <Step title="User Profiles & Data Storage">
        - Added a database structure to store user progress.
        - Designed profile management settings where users can adjust learning preferences.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Step 2: AI-Powered Learning Features with Replicate">
    <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eSDhk4VkVLE?si=-JhSjxsKIrPACNOK" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen />

    <Steps>
      <Step title="AI-Generated Courses">
        To make learning interactive, we implemented an AI-driven course generation system using [OpenAI’s GPT model](). Here's how it works:

        1. Users select a topic (e.g., “Questions to ask at a barbecue”).
        2. Lovable calls an [OpenAI Edge function]() to generate **10 engaging Spanish-language questions**.
        3. Users complete quizzes, track progress, and receive AI feedback on their answers.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Enhancing User Engagement">
        - **Dynamically Generated Questions**: Each quiz is AI-generated, ensuring fresh, unique content every time.
        - **Interactive Feedback**: The AI provides explanations for correct and incorrect answers to improve learning.
        - **Progress Tracking**: Users can save and revisit courses, enhancing retention and practice.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Enhancing Visual Engagement with Replicate">
        To add a visual learning element, we integrated [**Replicate’s Flux Schnell**]() image generation model:

        - **Automated Course Banners**: Every course dynamically generates an image matching the topic.
        - **Visually Immersive Experience**: AI-driven visuals enhance user engagement and retention.
        - **Fast Image Processing**: Using Replicate’s API, images are generated in real time without slowing down the experience.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Real-Time Voice Conversations">
        A major milestone in the app's development was the addition of **real-time Spanish-speaking practice** using [OpenAI’s real-time WebRTC API]() :

        - **Interactive AI Tutor**: Users can speak directly with an AI that dynamically responds in Spanish.
        - **Pronunciation Assistance**: The AI provides real-time corrections and suggestions.
        - **Seamless Conversations**: The natural flow of conversation makes it feel like interacting with a human tutor.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Step 3: Branding the App">
    <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fILdgFNqvmU?si=_Xg-XTMTQuBN7bE1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen />

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Establishing the Concept and Audience">
        Before branding, we defined our core goals:

        - **AI-powered chat** for real-time Spanish conversations.
        - **Automated quizzes** for quick practice sessions.
        - **Structured learning** with lesson storage and progress tracking.

        This helped shape our branding choices, ensuring they aligned with the app’s purpose.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Naming & Domain Selection">
        We aimed for a short, memorable name that reflected the **learning journey**. Using AI, we brainstormed and landed on **Ruta** (Spanish for “route” or “path”).

        #### **Process:**

        - **Brainstormed names** using AI for catchy Spanish words.
        - **Tested options** like "Camino" and "Verbo," but "Ruta" stood out.
        - **Checked domain availability** and secured **rutaapp.com** immediately.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Creating a Visual Identity">
        We quickly designed the brand:

        - **Logo**: A **compass-themed** icon sourced from design libraries and edited in Figma.
        - **Font Pairing**: Used a **bold, modern typeface** for the logo and a readable UI font for the app interface.
        - **Color Palette**: A **Tailwind CSS blue** scheme to symbolize travel and discovery.
        - **Styling Inspiration**: Experimented with **neo-brutalism**, tweaking contrast, shadows, and borders to create a visually engaging UI.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Building a Cohesive User Experience">
        Using Lovable, we ensured **visual consistency** across the app:

        - **Landing Page**: AI-generated with a dynamic, engaging hero section.
        - **Dashboard & Course Pages**: Styled to match the brand’s identity.
        - **Iterative Styling**: Applied **neo-brutalist** elements to test different design styles.
        - **User Flow Testing**: Ensured seamless navigation from signup to real-time chat.

        - **Set up payment workflows** for different plans.
        - **Tested transactions** for reliability.
        - **Synced Stripe dashboards** for client visibility.

        <Note>
          _Integrate Stripe into the app to allow subscription payments, including a dashboard for users to manage their plans_.
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="From Lovable to Cursor for Finalization">
