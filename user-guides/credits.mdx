description: 'Understanding daily and monthly message limits for Lovable'
---

LLMs are expensive, which is why Lovable limits the daily and/or monthly messages that result in successful edits you can send.

<Note>
  Daily edits renew at midnight UTC.
</Note>

## All Plans

- **Daily limit:** 5 free messages per day

Designed to give users a chance to explore and experience Lovable's features at no cost.

<Note>
  **What happens if my edit fails?**
  
  If an edit generation completely fails (build error) due to an error on our side, the credit for that edit will **not** be deducted from your daily/monthly total.
</Note>

## Legacy Plans

Some early access users are "grandfathered" on their existing plans, but can choose to move to the new plans before the old ("pro") plan is officially deprecated.
