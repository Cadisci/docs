## "Try to Fix" error loops

Building with Lovable makes coding faster and more intuitive, but even the best AI-powered development tools can run into issues. Sometimes, your code won’t execute as expected, or you might experience “unexpected behavior” where the AI doesn't implement what you had in mind.

[Here is a guide](https://lovable.dev/blog/never-get-stuck) to guide you through the *stuck* experience:

* **Use the 'Try to Fix' button first** – it automatically detects and resolves errors.

* **Plan ahead with a structured prompt** – describe your project in detail, step by step.

* **Leverage images** – visuals help Lovable understand UI-based errors.

* **Use the 'Revert' button if needed** – go back to a stable version and rebuild logically.

* **Ask Lovable for debugging help** – request an analysis of what went wrong and alternative solutions.

## General Troubleshooting

When using Lovable, you may occasionally encounter technical issues. Below are common problems and recommended actions to troubleshoot and resolve them.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Persistent 'Fix Error' Loops">
    <b>Problem:</b> Repeated failures where errors persist despite multiple attempts to fix them.

    <b>Solution:</b>

    * Approach with creativity: Adjust your input and prompts to help the AI understand the changes you’re trying to make.

    * Use Chat Mode: Engage the AI in chat mode for step-by-step guidance and tailored suggestions to break the loop.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Setting Environment Variables">
    <b>Problem:</b> Issues may arise when configuring environment variables, particularly with Supabase Edge Functions and Secrets.

    <b>Solution:</b>

    * Double-check the environment variable syntax and names.

    * Refer to the [Supabase Docs](https://supabase.com/docs) for guidance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="HTTP Fetch Failures">
    <b>Problem:</b> Errors during HTTP fetch requests can disrupt authentication or degrade app performance.

    <b>Solution:</b> If you're encountering an **HTTP server error** when working with APIs, it typically means the server you're trying to communicate with is not responding as expected. Here are a few steps to troubleshoot:

    * **Check the API Status:** The issue might be on the server side. Verify if the API provider has reported downtime or maintenance.

    * **Review Your API Request:** Ensure your request is correctly formatted, including headers, authentication tokens, and payload structure.

    * **Test with a Different Tool:** Use tools like Postman or cURL to see if the issue persists outside of Lovable AI.

    * **Inspect Error Codes:** HTTP errors like `500` (internal server error) indicate server-side issues, while `400` series errors often mean there’s something wrong with the request.

    * **Retry After Some Time:** Temporary issues can be resolved by waiting and trying again later.

    * **Check Rate Limits:** Some APIs restrict the number of requests within a time frame—exceeding limits may result in errors.

    If the issue persists and is related to Lovable AI’s platform, please reach out to our support team with error details for further assistance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't use Mermaid AI">
    Lovable AI supports Mermaid.js for creating diagrams and flowcharts directly within your AI-generated content. To use Mermaid AI with Lovable AI, follow these steps:

    * **Embed Mermaid syntax** in your prompt or generated code blocks. Lovable AI recognizes standard Mermaid.js syntax for flowcharts, sequence diagrams, Gantt charts, and more.

    * **Use triple backticks (` ``` `) with "mermaid"** as the language identifier to ensure proper rendering. Example: graph TD; A\[Start] --> B\{Decision}; B -->|Yes| C\[Continue]; B -->|No| D\[End];

    * **Verify output** to ensure the diagram is correctly interpreted. If you encounter formatting issues, check for syntax errors in your Mermaid.js code.

    * **Optimize complexity** by keeping diagrams concise, as very large or intricate diagrams may require manual adjustments.

    If Mermaid AI isn't rendering as expected within Lovable AI, feel free to reach out to our support team for assistance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Freezing or Loading Failures">
    <b>Problem:</b> Editor pages freeze, fail to load, or do not reflect the latest updates.

  <Accordion title="Setup wizard-style flows">
    Lovable is designed to support various workflow structures, including setup wizards and assessment-style questionnaires. However, some users have encountered issues with looping errors in complex multi-step flows that generate reports at the end. If you're experiencing this, we recommend:

    1. Breaking down the flow: Ensure that each step is clearly defined and that dependencies between steps are properly structured.

    2. Validating inputs at each stage: Sometimes, incorrect or unexpected inputs can cause loops—double-check validation rules.

    3. Using conditional logic carefully: If your flow depends on previous responses, review the conditions to prevent unintended loops.

    4. Testing with different user scenarios: Simulating various paths can help identify edge cases that may be causing issues.

    5. If the problem persists, please reach out to our support team with details of your setup, and we'll be happy to assist in troubleshooting.

## GitHub Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why are my recent commits not showing up in my Lovable project?">
    If you notice that your recent commits are missing from your Lovable project, it could be because the commits were made to a different branch on GitHub. Lovable currently only tracks commits made to the default branch (usually <code>main</code> or <code>master</code>). If you’ve been working on a new branch and haven’t merged it into the default branch, those commits won’t be picked up by Lovable.

    <b>To ensure your commits are tracked:</b>

    1. Merge your changes into the default branch.

    2. If you’re working on a new branch, consider switching back to the default branch for commits you want to appear in Lovable.
  </Accordion>
