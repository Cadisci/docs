## "Try to Fix" error loops

Building with Lovable makes coding faster and more intuitive—but even the best AI development tools can occasionally hit a snag. Sometimes your code won’t run as expected, or you might notice unexpected behavior where the AI interprets your intent incorrectly.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you navigate issues and get back on track:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use the 'Try to Fix' Button First">
    Click the **Try to Fix** button when an error shows up. Lovable will scan your logs, detect the issue, and attempt a quick fix. It's your fastest first move. If that doesn't work, it's time to dig deeper.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Diagnose Unexpected Behavior">
    Your code may run without errors but not behave as intended. That’s **unexpected behavior**—harder to spot and harder to fix. Try this:

    - **Review your original prompt** to confirm your instructions.
    - **Break it down**: Check individual components and logic.
    - **Add visuals**: Use screenshots to clarify what went wrong.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write More Effective Prompts">
    Clear, structured prompts lead to better results. Use this format:

    1. **Project Overview** – What are you building?
    2. **Page Structure** – List key pages/components.
    3. **Navigation Logic** – Describe user flow.
    4. **Visual Aids** – Upload wireframes or screenshots.
    5. **Implementation Steps** – Lay out the build order.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build in Logical Order">
    Structure matters. Follow this recommended flow:

    1. Create layout and pages.
    2. Connect Supabase or your backend.
    3. Set up authentication and user roles.
    4. Plan and organize feature logic.
    5. Prompt Lovable to implement features.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Chat-Only Mode for Clarity">
    When unsure, switch to **Chat-Only Mode**:

    - Ask Lovable to **analyze your project state**.
    - Request a **recap of attempted solutions**.
    - Prompt for **new directions** to solve persistent problems.
  </Step>
  <Step title="If You're Still Stuck: Advanced Tactics">
    Still no luck? Try this:

    - **Be exact** – Describe the bug and your expectations clearly.
    - **Use images** – Screenshots or videos help illustrate problems.
    - **Ask directly** – _"What else can we try?"_
    - **Rollback** – Restore to a working version and rebuild incrementally.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What’s Going Wrong? Common Troubleshooting Areas

Troubleshooting generally falls into these categories:

1. **UI or Layout Glitches**

2. **API or Backend Issues**

3. **Prompt Misinterpretations**

4. **AI Unresponsiveness or Misbehavior**

5. **Platform or Integration Errors**

Use the accordions below to identify specific issues and actions:

### General issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Need a fast diagnosis?">
    Jump into Chat-Only Mode and type: _"Something’s off. Can you walk me through what's happening and what you've tried?"_
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="UI or Layout Problems">
    - Check component hierarchy and styles.
- Use screenshots to explain visual bugs.
- Prompt Lovable with: *"Why is this element misaligned? Fix it."*
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="API & Backend Issues">
  - Ensure your API schema is current.
    - Validate environment variables and credentials.
    - Ask Lovable: *"What methods are being used in this call?"*
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When completely stuck">
    - Prompt: "Take a step back. Analyze the error and suggest a different approach."
    - Break the task into smaller parts instead of solving everything at once.
    - Use the revert button if errors persist.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Loading errors">
    This should not happen at all. Please report to the support team.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Code sandbox error">
    This should not happen at all. Please report to the support team.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Not found preview or spinning up sandbox">
    This should not happen at all. Try a hard refresh. If unresolved, contact support.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### AI Reliability

- Refine prompts with clear structure.
- Use Chat-Only Mode to test ideas safely.
- Ask Lovable to explain why it chose a particular implementation.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Avoiding AI mistakes in prompt engineering">
    - Keep prompts clear and structured.
    - Use reverse meta prompting to refine results.
    - Test in chat mode before applying major changes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="AI not responding">
    This should not happen at all. Please report to the support team in case the Lovable AI is not responding.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Persistent Fix error loops">
    Adjust your input and prompts to help the AI understand the changes you’re trying to make or engage the AI in chat mode for step-by-step guidance and tailored suggestions to break the loop.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Refactor broke everything">
    Making smaller, incremental changes can help bypass this issue. If the problem persists, go to the history of your codebase to restore a stable version or use chat mode to debug and search for advice.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Error loops, AI not resolving, AI hallucinations or breaking things">
    No worries, that happens. Please revert to a stable version and for the next prompt, be more specific, use the visual editing tool and add a knowledge file to give more context.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="AI not doing changes">
    It's likely a symptom of the AI editing files it wasn’t supposed to or getting confused. Be super specific for your next prompt, and if it doesn't work, go into the code to edit it manually.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Chat mode not responding or incomplete">
    This error was fixed by our engineering team and should not happen. Please report if it happens again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Unexpected Crashes, Errors, or Loops">
    - Don’t keep retrying the same prompt. Rephrase or simplify.
- Ask Lovable: *"List all the fixes we’ve tried so far."*
- If broken, rollback and rebuild one step at a time.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
