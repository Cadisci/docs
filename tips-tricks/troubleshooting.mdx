## "Try to Fix" error loops

Building with Lovable makes coding faster and more intuitive, but even the best AI-powered development tools can run into issues. Sometimes, your code won’t execute as expected, or you might experience “unexpected behavior” where the AI doesn't implement what you had in mind.

Here is a guide to guide you through the *stuck* experience:

<Steps>
  <Step title="The 'Try to Fix' Button: First Line of Defense">
    When you hit an error, your first move should be the **Try to Fix** button. This triggers Lovable to analyze logs, detect errors, and attempt a correction automatically. It’s quick and usually effective. However, for complex features, the AI might not always get it right on the first try. If the fix doesn’t work, move on to a more detailed debugging approach.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Understanding 'Unexpected Behavior'">
    Sometimes, your code runs without errors, but your app isn’t functioning the way you expected. This is **Unexpected Behavior**, and it’s one of the hardest things to debug. The best approach?

    * **Retrace your steps** – review what you asked Lovable to do.

    * **Break it down** – check if a particular section of your implementation is misaligned.

    * **Use images** – show Lovable the UI result versus what you expected.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Writing Better Prompts: Start with a Strong Foundation">
    Many issues can be avoided with a well-structured prompt. Instead of jumping straight into features, follow this **best practice** format:

    1. **Project Overview** – Describe what you’re building.

    2. **Page Structure** – List the key pages and components.

    3. **Navigation Logic** – Explain how users will move through the app.

    4. **Screenshots/Wireframes** – Upload visuals if available.

    5. **Implementation Order** – Specify logical steps, e.g., “Start by creating pages and layout before adding Supabase.”
  </Step>

  <Step title="Follow the Right Implementation Order">
    If you structure your project build logically, it reduces the risk of errors down the line. Stick to this recommended workflow:

    1. **Create pages and layout**

    2. **Integrate Supabase for backend/database functionality**

    3. **Implement authentication (Auth) and user roles**

    4. **Plan out and sequence features**

    5. **Start prompting for feature implementation**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Using the Chat-Only Mode for Debugging">
    When you're unsure about how to structure your prompts or debug an issue, switch to **Chat-Only Mode**:

    * Ask Lovable to **review** what you’re trying to do.

    * Request Lovable to **list the solutions it has already attempted**.

    * Get Lovable to **suggest a different approach** if you’re stuck in an error loop.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Advanced Troubleshooting: What If You’re Still Stuck?">
    If the **Try to Fix** button isn't solving your problem, and you're not making progress, try these:

    * **Be more specific** – Describe exactly what’s wrong, including what you expected versus what happened.

    * **Use images** – Screenshots clarify UI-based issues.

    * **Ask Lovable for debugging help** – Example: *“What solutions have we tried so far? What else can we do?”*

    * **Revert to a previous working state** – If things spiral out of control, go back and implement methodically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Debugging Specific Issues">
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="For UI-related problems:">
        * Use screenshots to show the AI how things render incorrectly.

        * Ask Lovable: *“Explain why this UI behaves this way. What’s the best fix?”*

        * If Try to Fix doesn’t work, try tweaking component structures.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="For API integration issues:">
        * Double-check that you’re using the latest API schema.

        * Ensure Supabase (or any backend) is correctly connected before calling data.

        * Ask Lovable: *“What API methods are being used? Are they correctly formatted?”*
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="When completely stuck:">
        * Prompt: *“Take a step back. Analyze the error and suggest a different approach.”*

        * Break the task into smaller parts instead of solving everything at once.

        * Use the revert button if errors persist.

## Tips & Tricks

### General Troubleshooting

When using Lovable, you may occasionally encounter technical issues. Below are common problems and recommended actions to troubleshoot and resolve them.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Persistent 'Fix Error' Loops">
    <b>Problem:</b> Repeated failures where errors persist despite multiple attempts to fix them.

    <b>Solution:</b>

    * Approach with creativity: Adjust your input and prompts to help the AI understand the changes you’re trying to make.

    * Use Chat Mode: Engage the AI in chat mode for step-by-step guidance and tailored suggestions to break the loop.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Setting Environment Variables">
    <b>Problem:</b> Issues may arise when configuring environment variables, particularly with Supabase Edge Functions and Secrets.

    <b>Solution:</b>

    * Double-check the environment variable syntax and names.

    * Refer to the [Supabase Docs](https://supabase.com/docs) for guidance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="HTTP Fetch Failures">
    <b>Problem:</b> Errors during HTTP fetch requests can disrupt authentication or degrade app performance.

    <b>Solution:</b> If you're encountering an **HTTP server error** when working with APIs, it typically means the server you're trying to communicate with is not responding as expected. Here are a few steps to troubleshoot:

    * **Check the API Status:** The issue might be on the server side. Verify if the API provider has reported downtime or maintenance.

    * **Review Your API Request:** Ensure your request is correctly formatted, including headers, authentication tokens, and payload structure.

    * **Test with a Different Tool:** Use tools like Postman or cURL to see if the issue persists outside of Lovable AI.

    * **Inspect Error Codes:** HTTP errors like `500` (internal server error) indicate server-side issues, while `400` series errors often mean there’s something wrong with the request.

    * **Retry After Some Time:** Temporary issues can be resolved by waiting and trying again later.

    * **Check Rate Limits:** Some APIs restrict the number of requests within a time frame—exceeding limits may result in errors.

    If the issue persists and is related to Lovable AI’s platform, please reach out to our support team with error details for further assistance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't use Mermaid AI">
    Lovable AI supports Mermaid.js for creating diagrams and flowcharts directly within your AI-generated content. To use Mermaid AI with Lovable AI, follow these steps:

    * **Embed Mermaid syntax** in your prompt or generated code blocks. Lovable AI recognizes standard Mermaid.js syntax for flowcharts, sequence diagrams, Gantt charts, and more.

    * **Use triple backticks (` ``` `) with "mermaid"** as the language identifier to ensure proper rendering. Example: graph TD; A\[Start] --> B\{Decision}; B -->|Yes| C\[Continue]; B -->|No| D\[End];

    * **Verify output** to ensure the diagram is correctly interpreted. If you encounter formatting issues, check for syntax errors in your Mermaid.js code.

    * **Optimize complexity** by keeping diagrams concise, as very large or intricate diagrams may require manual adjustments.

    If Mermaid AI isn't rendering as expected within Lovable AI, feel free to reach out to our support team for assistance.

### GitHub Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why are my recent commits not showing up in my Lovable project?">
    If you notice that your recent commits are missing from your Lovable project, it could be because the commits were made to a different branch on GitHub. Lovable currently only tracks commits made to the default branch (usually <code>main</code> or <code>master</code>). If you’ve been working on a new branch and haven’t merged it into the default branch, those commits won’t be picked up by Lovable.

    <b>To ensure your commits are tracked:</b>

    1. Merge your changes into the default branch.

    2. If you’re working on a new branch, consider switching back to the default branch for commits you want to appear in Lovable.
