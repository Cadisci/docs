When using Lovable, you may occasionally encounter technical issues. Below are common problems and recommended actions to troubleshoot and resolve them.

## Persistent "Fix Error" Loops

**Problem:** Repeated failures where errors persist despite multiple attempts to fix them.

**Solution:**

* Approach with creativity: Adjust your input and prompts to help the AI understand the changes you’re trying to make.

* Use Chat Mode: Engage the AI in chat mode for step-by-step guidance and tailored suggestions to break the loop.

## Setting Environment Variables

**Problem:** Issues may arise when configuring environment variables, particularly when working with Supabase Edge Functions and Secrets.

**Solution:**

* Double-check the environment variable syntax and names.

* Refer to the [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs) / [Edge Functions](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/sdkziisptnetvtxvlysg/functions) / [Secrets](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/secrets) documentation for detailed instructions.

## HTTP Fetch Failures

**Problem:** Errors during HTTP fetch requests can disrupt authentication or degrade app performance.

**Solution:** Copy and paste the exact error message into the chat to get context-specific advice from the AI.

## Freezing or Loading Failures

**Problem:** Settings or editor pages freeze, fail to load, or do not reflect the latest updates.

**Solution:** Report this as a bug by creating a ticket [via our feedback portal](https://lovable.dev/support).

## Rollback Feature Fails

**Problem:** Unable to revert to a previous state of the project.

**Solution:** Submit a bug report [via our feedback portal](https://lovable.dev/support).

## Cloud Deployment Issues

**Problem:** Apps fail to redeploy or get stuck in a spinning loop during deployment.

**Solution:** File a bug report [via our feedback portal](https://lovable.dev/support).

## AI-Related Errors

**Problem:** The AI is not resolving, hallucinating, or breaking things.
**Solution:**

* Revert to a stable version of your application.

* For better results in future prompts:

  * Be specific and clear. Refer to our [Prompting Handbook]() for guidance.

  * Use the select tool to precisely edit content.

  * Provide context by adding relevant documentation or a knowledge base.

## Refactor Broke Everything in My Code

**Problem:** Code refactor caused major issues.

**Solution:**

* Revert to a stable version of your application.

* Make smaller, incremental changes and refine your prompts for clarity.

* Check your codebase history (e.g., GitHub), copy the error message, and use debugging tools like ChatGPT.

## AI Is Not Responding

**Problem:** The AI is not responding to your messages and the chat is stuck.

**Solution:** Disconnect and reconnect Supabase, as this is likely related to connection issues. If this doesn't work, please try restoring to an earlier stable version. 

## AI Not Making Changes

**Problem:** The AI is not implementing expected edits.

**Solution:**

* Ensure your prompts are specific (use the select tool if needed).

* If the issue persists, manually edit the code in GitHub or VSCode.

## Preview Shows a Blank Screen

**Problem:** Preview displays a white or blank screen.

**Solution:** Revert to a stable version and check the console logs for relevant error messages.
