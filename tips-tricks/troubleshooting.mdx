## "Try to Fix" error loops

Building with Lovable makes coding faster and more intuitive—but even the best AI development tools can occasionally hit a snag. Sometimes your code won't run as expected, or you might notice unexpected behavior where the AI interprets your intent incorrectly.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you navigate issues and get back on track:

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0W8bsbHh2p8?si=p4kWhkdu0PEbgGXm" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen />

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use the Try to Fix Button First">
    Click the **Try to Fix** button when an error shows up. Lovable will scan your logs, detect the issue, and attempt a quick fix. It's your fastest first move. If that doesn't work, it's time to dig deeper.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Diagnose Unexpected Behavior">
    Your code may run without errors but not behave as intended. That's **unexpected behavior**—harder to spot and harder to fix. Try this:

    - **Review your original prompt** to confirm your instructions.
    - **Break it down**: Check individual components and logic.
    - **Add visuals**: Use screenshots to clarify what went wrong.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write More Effective Prompts">
    Clear, structured prompts lead to better results. Use this format:

    1. **Project Overview** – What are you building?
    2. **Page Structure** – List key pages/components.
    3. **Navigation Logic** – Describe user flow.
    4. **Visual Aids** – Upload wireframes or screenshots.
    5. **Implementation Steps** – Lay out the build order.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build in Logical Order">
    Structure matters. Follow this recommended flow:

    1. Create layout and pages.
    2. Connect Supabase or your backend.
    3. Set up authentication and user roles.
    4. Plan and organize feature logic.
    5. Prompt Lovable to implement features.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Chat-Only Mode for Clarity">
    When unsure, switch to **Chat-Only Mode**:

    - Ask Lovable to **analyze your project state**.
    - Request a **recap of attempted solutions**.
    - Prompt for **new directions** to solve persistent problems.
  </Step>
  <Step title="If You're Still Stuck: Advanced Tactics">
    Still no luck? Try this:

    - **Be exact** – Describe the bug and your expectations clearly.
    - **Use images** – Screenshots or videos help illustrate problems.
    - **Ask directly** – "What else can we try?"
    - **Rollback** – Restore to a working version and rebuild incrementally.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What's Going Wrong? Common Troubleshooting Areas

Troubleshooting generally falls into these categories:

1. **UI or Layout Glitches**
2. **API or Backend Issues**
3. **Prompt Misinterpretations**

    2. Check for typos in import statements
    3. Verify the package name and version in package.json
    4. Install peer dependencies when prompted
    5. Check for compatibility with your React and TypeScript versions
    6. Look for alternative packages if one doesn't work well

    #### **Working with shadcn/ui**

    Lovable comes with shadcn/ui pre-installed. Remember that:

    - shadcn/ui components are imported from `@/components/ui/`
    - You can use all components in the shadcn/ui documentation
    - Don't modify the shadcn/ui component files directly
    - Create wrapper components if you need custom behavior
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Page Navigation">
    #### **Common Navigation Problems**

    - **Page not found:** Routes not properly configured
    - **Navigation fails:** Links not working correctly
    - **Full page reloads:** Using `<a>` instead of React Router's `<Link>`
    - **Parameters not accessible:** Route params not being extracted
    - **Nested routes issues:** Problems with nested route definitions

    #### **How to Fix Navigation Issues**

    1. Verify that all routes are correctly defined in your router configuration
    2. Use `<Link>` from react-router-dom instead of `<a>` tags
    3. Check path spellings in your route definitions
    4. For dynamic routes, ensure parameters are correctly defined with `:paramName`
    5. Use `useParams()` to access route parameters
    6. For programmatic navigation, use `useNavigate()` hook

    #### **Navigation Best Practices**

    - Organize routes logically based on your application structure
    - Consider using lazy loading for routes to improve performance
    - Add proper error handling for invalid routes (404 pages)
    - Use `useLocation()` to read query parameters
    - Implement route guards for protected routes if needed

    - **Accessing the console:** Right-click → Inspect → Console tab
    - **Viewing errors:** Red error messages in the console
    - **Adding console logs:** Use `console.log()`, `console.error()`, etc.
    - **Filtering messages:** Use the dropdown filters in the console panel

    #### **Effective Console Debugging**

    1. Log variable values at different points in your code
    2. Use `console.table()` for displaying arrays or objects
    3. Group related logs with `console.group()` and `console.groupEnd()`
    4. Use `console.trace()` to show the call stack
    5. Set breakpoints by clicking line numbers in the Sources tab
    6. Watch expressions by adding them in the Watch panel

    #### **Console Tips for React**

    - Install React Developer Tools for component inspection
    - Log component props and state to debug rendering issues
    - Use conditional breakpoints for specific scenarios
    - Check for React-specific warnings and errors
    - Monitor network requests in the Network tab

    **Debugging Tip:**

    Use `console.log({variableName})` instead of `console.log(variableName)` to see both the variable name and value in the console.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Memory Issues">
    #### **Common Memory Problems**

    - **Memory leaks:** Resources not being properly released
    - **High CPU usage:** Excessive processing or infinite loops
    - **Slow performance:** Inefficient code or large data structures
    - **Page crashes:** Out of memory errors
    - **Growing memory usage:** Memory increasing over time

    #### **Identifying Memory Issues**

    1. Use Chrome DevTools Memory tab to create heap snapshots
    2. Monitor memory usage in Performance tab
    3. Look for components that don't unmount properly
    4. Check for event listeners that aren't removed
    5. Identify large data structures that could be optimized

    #### **Fixing Memory Leaks**

    - Clean up event listeners in `useEffect` return functions
    - Cancel fetch requests when components unmount
    - Unsubscribe from subscriptions (observables, WebSockets)
    - Clear intervals and timeouts when no longer needed
    - Avoid creating functions inside render that create closures over large data
    - Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary recreations

    **Memory optimization tip:**

    <Tip>
      For large lists, consider implementing virtualization (using libraries like react-window or react-virtualized) to render only visible items instead of the entire list at once.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Browser Compatibility">
    #### **Common Browser Compatibility Issues**

    - **Different rendering:** CSS behaves differently across browsers
    - **Missing features:** Modern JavaScript features not supported in older browsers
    - **Browser-specific bugs:** Issues unique to certain browsers
    - **Mobile quirks:** Problems specific to mobile browsers
    - **Input handling differences:** Form elements behave differently

    #### **Ensuring Cross-Browser Compatibility**

    1. Use Babel to transpile modern JavaScript for older browsers
    2. Include polyfills for missing browser features
    3. Leverage CSS prefixes or use a tool like Autoprefixer
    4. Test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
    5. Use feature detection instead of browser detection
    6. Follow web standards and avoid browser-specific hacks

    #### **Tools for Browser Compatibility**

    - [**caniuse.com**](http://caniuse.com)**:** Check feature support across browsers
    - **BrowserStack:** Test on multiple browsers and devices
    - **Autoprefixer:** Automatically add vendor prefixes to CSS
    - **@babel/preset-env:** Target specific browser versions
    - **core-js:** Polyfills for modern JavaScript features

    <Tip>
      Instead of supporting very old browsers, consider implementing a browser detection system that shows a friendly message to users on unsupported browsers, directing them to upgrade.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Infinite Re-render Loops">
    #### **Common Causes of Infinite Loops**

    - **Missing dependency array:** `useEffect` without dependencies
    - **State updates in render:** Calling setState during render phase
    - **State updates in useEffect:** Without proper dependency control
    - **Mutable references:** Modifying objects or arrays directly
    - **Props changing in parent:** Child component updates causing parent re-renders

    #### **How to Fix Infinite Loops**

    1. Ensure `useEffect` has a proper dependency array
    2. Use `useCallback` for functions passed as props
    3. Add conditional checks before setting state
    4. Use functional updates for state based on previous values
    5. Check for object/array stability with `useMemo`
    6. Use `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders

    #### **Debugging Infinite Loops**

    - Add console logs to track component renders
    - Use React DevTools to profile renders
    - Check for "Maximum update depth exceeded" error messages
    - Set breakpoints in Chrome DevTools
    - Look for rapidly increasing memory usage

    **Common infinite loop pattern:**

    `useEffect(() => { setData(newData); // This will cause a re-render }, [someValue]); // If someValue changes on every render, you get an infinite loop`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Responsive Design Problems">
    #### **Common Responsive Design Challenges**

    - **Layout breaks on mobile:** Elements overlap or overflow
    - **Text scaling issues:** Font sizes too large or small on different screens
    - **Image sizing problems:** Images not properly scaling
    - **Touch targets too small:** Buttons or links difficult to tap on mobile
    - **Content overflow:** Content extending beyond viewport
    - **Media query issues:** Breakpoints not working as expected

    #### **Responsive Design Best Practices**

    1. Use mobile-first approach (design for mobile, then expand)
    2. Implement fluid layouts with flexbox and grid
    3. Use relative units (%, em, rem) instead of fixed pixels
    4. Set appropriate viewport meta tag
    5. Test designs across multiple screen sizes
    6. Use responsive images with proper sizing
    7. Ensure touch targets are at least 44x44px for mobile

    #### **Tailwind CSS for Responsive Design**

    Tailwind makes responsive design easier with its breakpoint prefixes:

    - `sm:` - small screens (640px and up)
    - `md:` - medium screens (768px and up)
    - `lg:` - large screens (1024px and up)
    - `xl:` - extra large screens (1280px and up)
    - `2xl:` - 2x extra large screens (1536px and up)

    Example of responsive layout with Tailwind:

    ```
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
      <div className="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow">Item 1</div>
      <div className="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow">Item 2</div>
      <div className="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow">Item 3</div>
    </div>
    ```

    <Tip>
      Use Chrome DevTools Device Mode (toggle device toolbar) to quickly test your design on different device sizes and orientations.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Custom Domain Setup">
    To connect your custom domain to your Lovable app:

    1. Navigate to Project → Settings → Domains in Lovable
    2. Click "Add Domain" and enter your domain name
    3. Update your DNS settings as instructed
    4. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)

    <Info>
      Custom domain functionality requires a paid Lovable plan.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="DNS Configuration">
    Example DNS settings for your domain registrar:

    ```
    # For apex domain (example.com):
    Type: A
    Name: @
    Value: 76.76.21.21
    
    # For www subdomain:
    Type: CNAME
    Name: www
    Value: yourapp.lovable.app
    ```

    #### **DNS Settings Explanation:**

    - **A Record:** Points your root domain to Lovable's IP address
    - **CNAME Record:** Creates an alias from www to your Lovable app
    - **TTL (Time-to-Live):** Set to 3600 (1 hour) or lower for faster propagation

    #### **DNS Verification:**

    To verify your DNS settings are correct, you can use:

    - [**<u>DNSChecker.org</u>**](https://dnschecker.org/)
    - [**<u>MXToolbox</u>**](https://mxtoolbox.com/)
    - Command line: `dig example.com` or `nslookup example.com`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Common Domain Issues">
    If your custom domain isn't working:

    - Verify DNS settings are configured exactly as specified
    - Check if your domain has DNSSEC enabled (might cause issues)
    - Use a DNS lookup tool to verify your records have propagated
    - Clear your browser cache or try in incognito mode
    - Wait at least 24-48 hours for DNS changes to fully propagate
    - Ensure your domain is properly verified in the Lovable dashboard
    - Check if your domain registrar has extra security features blocking the transfer

    #### **Troubleshooting Steps:**

    1. Verify your domain is active and not expired
    2. Check for conflicting DNS records
    3. Temporarily disable DNSSEC if you're having issues
    4. Ensure no domain forwarding is enabled at your registrar
    5. Try accessing your site from a different network
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="SSL Certificate Issues">
    Lovable automatically provisions SSL certificates for custom domains. If you're experiencing SSL issues:

    - Ensure your DNS is properly configured
    - Check if your domain has CAA records that might restrict certificate issuance
    - Wait up to 24 hours for the certificate to be issued
    - Verify your browser isn't caching an old certificate
    - Check for certificate transparency logs to see if a certificate was issued
    - Contact Lovable support if issues persist

    #### **Common SSL Errors:**

    - **ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID:** Domain doesn't match certificate
    - **ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID:** Certificate not trusted by browser
    - **SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER:** Certificate issuer unknown
    - **SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN:** Domain doesn't match certificate

    <Info>
      \*\*SSL Security Note: \*\*Lovable uses Let's Encrypt to provision SSL certificates. These certificates are valid for 90 days and are automatically renewed.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Working with Subdomains">
    To set up subdomains for your Lovable app:

    #### **Option 1: Direct Subdomain Configuration**

    1. Navigate to Project → Settings → Domains
    2. Click "Add Domain" and enter your subdomain (e.g., [app.example.com](http://app.example.com))
    3. Add a CNAME record at your DNS provider:

    ```
    Type: CNAME
    Name: app
    Value: yourapp.lovable.app
    ```

    #### **Option 2: Wildcard Subdomain**

    To support multiple subdomains with one configuration:

    ```
    Type: CNAME
    Name: *
    Value: yourapp.lovable.app
    ```

    Note: Wildcard CNAME records might not be supported by all DNS providers.

    #### **Subdomain Best Practices:**

    - Use consistent naming conventions ([app.example.com](http://app.example.com), [api.example.com](http://api.example.com))
    - Consider using subdomains for different environments ([staging.example.com](http://staging.example.com))
    - Remember each subdomain needs its own SSL certificate, which Lovable handles automatically

  <Accordion title="Role-Based Security (RLS) in Supabase">
    ### **RLS Basics**

    Row Level Security (RLS) allows you to control which rows users can access in your Supabase tables. Without proper RLS policies:

    - Your data may be unprotected and accessible to anyone
    - Or users might be unable to access data they should see

    If RLS is enabled:

    - Define clear access policies.
    - Test via Supabase SQL editor.
    - Ensure users are authenticated.

    ### **Enabling RLS on Tables**

    How to enable RLS on your Supabase tables:

    1. Go to the Supabase dashboard and select your project
    2. Navigate to **Table Editor** in the left sidebar
    3. Select the table you want to secure
    4. Click on **Authentication** tab
    5. Toggle **Enable RLS** to ON
    6. Create policies to define access rules (without policies, no access is granted)

    It's recommended to enable RLS on all tables from the beginning of your project development.

    ### **Common RLS Issues**

    ### 

    If you're experiencing data access problems:

    - **No Data Returned:** RLS might be too restrictive
    - **Security Concerns:** RLS might be too permissive
    - **Errors When Inserting:** Check your INSERT policies
    - **Auth Issues:** Ensure the user is properly authenticated
    - **Unexpected Access:** Anonymous users might have unintended access

    ### **Troubleshooting auth.uid() Issues**

    If your RLS policies using auth.uid() aren't working as expected:

    - **User Not Authenticated:** Verify that the user is properly signed in
    - **JWT Token Issues:** Check if the JWT token is being correctly passed to Supabase
    - **Column Type Mismatch:** Ensure your user_id column type matches the auth.uid() type (typically UUID)
    - **Case Sensitivity:** UUID comparisons should be case-sensitive
    - **Incorrect Column Name:** Double-check that the column name in your policy matches the database

    A common issue is comparing auth.uid() to a user_id stored as text when auth.uid() returns a UUID. Ensure type consistency.

    ### **Example RLS Policies**

    Here are common RLS policy patterns:

    ```
    -- Allow users to read only their own data
    CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own data" ON "profiles"
      FOR SELECT
      USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
    
    -- Allow authenticated users to insert their own data
    CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own data" ON "profiles"
      FOR INSERT
      WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
    
    -- Allow public access to certain data
    CREATE POLICY "Public access to published posts" ON "posts"
      FOR SELECT
      USING (is_published = true);
    ```

    ### **Testing RLS Policies**

    How to verify your RLS policies are working correctly:

    1. Use the Supabase dashboard to test policies with different roles
    2. Create test users and verify access patterns
    3. Log SQL errors from your Lovable app for debugging
    4. Test both authenticated and anonymous access

    #### **Best Practice**

    Always enable RLS on all tables and explicitly create policies for access patterns. Start with restrictive policies and gradually open them up as needed.

    ### **Advanced RLS Techniques**

    Advanced RLS patterns for Lovable projects

    ### **Role-Based Access**

    Implementing role-based permissions with RLS:

    ```
    -- Create a view to get user roles
    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_role()
    RETURNS TEXT AS $$
      SELECT role FROM user_roles WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    $$ LANGUAGE SQL;
    
    -- Policy that checks user role
    CREATE POLICY "Admins can do anything" ON "documents"
      USING (get_user_role() = 'admin');
    ```

    ### **Team/Organization Access**

    Allowing users to access team resources:

    ```
    -- Allow access to team members
    CREATE POLICY "Team members can view" ON "team_documents"
      FOR SELECT
      USING (
        auth.uid() IN (
          SELECT user_id FROM team_members 
          WHERE team_id = team_documents.team_id
        )
      );
    ```

    ### **RLS Performance Considerations**

    Be aware of these performance aspects when using RLS:

    - Complex policies can slow down queries
    - Joins in policies can be particularly expensive
    - Consider indexing columns used in RLS conditions
    - For large tables, consider materialized views or other optimizations

    ### **Working with Complex Policy Requirements**

    Solutions for advanced access control scenarios:

    - **Multiple Conditions:** Combine conditions with AND/OR operators
    - **Hierarchical Access:** Use recursive queries or path enumeration patterns
    - **Temporary Access:** Implement time-based conditions (e.g., expiry dates)
    - **Delegated Permissions:** Create sharing mechanisms with junction tables
    - **Row-Level Ownership Transfer:** Consider triggers to maintain ownership history

    For very complex access patterns, consider using database functions to encapsulate the logic and make your policies more readable.

    ### **Multi-Tenant RLS Strategies**

    Implementing secure multi-tenant data access:

    - **Tenant Isolation:** Include tenant_id in all tables requiring isolation
    - **Shared Tables:** Define which tables should be shared vs. tenant-specific
    - **Cross-Tenant Access:** Implement explicit sharing mechanisms when needed
    - **Tenant Hierarchy:** Consider parent-child relationships between organizations
    - **User-Tenant Association:** Track which tenants each user belongs to

    ```
    -- Basic multi-tenant RLS policy
    CREATE POLICY "Tenant isolation" ON "tenant_data"
      USING (
        tenant_id IN (
          SELECT tenant_id FROM tenant_members
          WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
        )
      );
    ```

    Consider using database schemas for complete tenant isolation if your application requires strict separation.

    ### **Debugging RLS Issues**

    Tips for troubleshooting complex RLS problems:

    1. Temporarily disable RLS to verify it's the source of the issue
    2. Add logging to track SQL queries and auth states
    3. Test simpler policies first, then add complexity
    4. Verify that auth.uid() is returning the expected values
    5. Use the Supabase dashboard's policy tester to validate policies

    #### **Common Pitfall**

    A frequent issue is enabling RLS on a table but forgetting to create any policies. This results in no access to the table's data, as the default behavior is to deny all access when RLS is enabled.

    ### **JWT Claims and Authentication**

    Using JWT claims for enhanced security

    ### **Understanding JWT Claims**

    JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) contain claims that can be used in RLS policies:

    - Standard claims like subject (sub), issuer (iss), expiration (exp)
    - Custom claims for roles, permissions, or user attributes
    - Claims are verified by Supabase before being used in RLS

    ### **Accessing JWT Data in RLS**

    Examples of accessing JWT claim data in RLS policies:

    ```
    -- Access the user's ID (UUID)
    auth.uid()
    
    -- Check if the user has a specific role
    auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'admin'
    
    -- Access custom claims
    auth.jwt() ->> 'custom_claim' = 'value'
    
    -- Check if user is authenticated at all
    auth.role() = 'authenticated'
    ```

    ### **Working with Custom Claims**

    Setting and using custom claims in Supabase:

    1. Create or update claims during authentication or user actions
    2. Use claims to store frequently needed user data
    3. Keep claims small to avoid large JWT tokens
    4. Update claims when relevant user data changes

    ```
    // Example: Setting custom claims during sign-in
    const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
      email,
      password,
      options: {
        data: {
          role: 'admin',
          org_id: '123',
          permissions: ['read', 'write']
        }
      }
    });
    
    // Accessing those claims in RLS
    CREATE POLICY "Admin access" ON "documents"
      USING (auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'admin');
    ```

    Custom claims are useful for frequently accessed user attributes but should not replace proper database lookups for complex permissions.
