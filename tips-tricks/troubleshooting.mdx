## "Try to Fix" error loops 

Building with Lovable makes coding faster and more intuitive—but even the best AI development tools can occasionally hit a snag. Sometimes your code won't run as expected, or you might notice unexpected behavior where the AI interprets your intent incorrectly.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you navigate issues and get back on track:

  title="YouTube video player"

  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
  referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
  allowfullscreen
/>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use the Try to Fix Button First">
    Click the **Try to Fix** button when an error shows up. Lovable will scan your logs, detect the issue, and attempt a quick fix. It's your fastest first move. If that doesn't work, it's time to dig deeper.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Diagnose Unexpected Behavior">
    Your code may run without errors but not behave as intended. That's **unexpected behavior**—harder to spot and harder to fix. Try this:

    - **Review your original prompt** to confirm your instructions.
    - **Break it down**: Check individual components and logic.
    - **Add visuals**: Use screenshots to clarify what went wrong.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write More Effective Prompts">
    Clear, structured prompts lead to better results. Use this format:

    1. **Project Overview** – What are you building?
    2. **Page Structure** – List key pages/components.
    3. **Navigation Logic** – Describe user flow.
    4. **Visual Aids** – Upload wireframes or screenshots.
    5. **Implementation Steps** – Lay out the build order.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build in Logical Order">
    Structure matters. Follow this recommended flow:

    1. Create layout and pages.
    2. Connect Supabase or your backend.
    3. Set up authentication and user roles.
    4. Plan and organize feature logic.
    5. Prompt Lovable to implement features.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Chat-Only Mode for Clarity">
    When unsure, switch to **Chat-Only Mode**:

    - Ask Lovable to **analyze your project state**.
    - Request a **recap of attempted solutions**.
    - Prompt for **new directions** to solve persistent problems.
  </Step>
  <Step title="If You're Still Stuck: Advanced Tactics">
    Still no luck? Try this:

    - **Be exact** – Describe the bug and your expectations clearly.
    - **Use images** – Screenshots or videos help illustrate problems.
    - **Ask directly** – "What else can we try?"
    - **Rollback** – Restore to a working version and rebuild incrementally.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What's Going Wrong? Common Troubleshooting Areas

Troubleshooting generally falls into these categories:

1. **UI or Layout Glitches**
2. **API or Backend Issues**
3. **Prompt Misinterpretations**
4. **AI Unresponsiveness or Misbehavior**
5. **Platform or Integration Errors**

Use the accordions below to identify specific issues and actions:

## Comprehensive Debugging Manual

[This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dfIy5rtkPN9Zi4smX1VAbfbhAiEyBvVw8p7B8kJiEVs/edit?tab=t.0) was written by a Lovable power user in our Discord community.

### How to use it

1. **Download** it as `Comprehensive_Debugging_Manual.md`.  
2. **Upload** it to your GitHub project.
3. Prompt Lovable: "Read this document. Let me know if it helps. Then create a prompt I should use to troubleshoot this issue."
4. After Lovable responds, say: "Before you proceed, explain in detail why you think this will work. Wait for my approval."

This ensures deeper understanding before implementing any fix.
