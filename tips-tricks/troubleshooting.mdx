When using Lovable, you may occasionally encounter technical issues. Below are some common problems, along with recommended actions to troubleshoot and resolve them.

## Persistent "Fix Error" Loops

You may experience repeated failures where errors seem to persist despite multiple attempts to fix them.

- **Approach with Creativity:** Adjust your input and prompts to help the AI understand the changes you’re trying to make.
- **Use Chat Mode:** Engage the AI in chat mode for step-by-step guidance and tailored suggestions to break the loop.

## Setting Environment Variables

Issues may arise when configuring environment variables, particularly when working with Supabase Edge Functions and Secrets.

- Double-check the environment variable syntax and names.
- Refer to the [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs) / [Edge Functions](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/sdkziisptnetvtxvlysg/functions) / [Secrets](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/secrets) documentation for detailed instructions.

## HTTP Fetch Failures

Errors during HTTP fetch requests can disrupt authentication or degrade app performance.

- Copy and paste the exact error message into the chat to get context-specific advice from the AI.
