## "Try to Fix" error loops

Building with Lovable makes coding faster and more intuitive, but even the best AI-powered development tools can run into issues. Sometimes, your code won’t execute as expected, or you might experience “unexpected behavior” where the AI doesn't implement what you had in mind. 

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0W8bsbHh2p8?si=UEwMmMxl6Ch3yxdA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen />

Here is a guide to guide you through the *stuck* experience:

<Steps>
  <Step title="The 'Try to Fix' Button: First Line of Defense">
    When you hit an error, your first move should be the **Try to Fix** button. This triggers Lovable to analyze logs, detect errors, and attempt a correction automatically. It’s quick and usually effective. However, for complex features, the AI might not always get it right on the first try. If the fix doesn’t work, move on to a more detailed debugging approach.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Understanding 'Unexpected Behavior'">
    Sometimes, your code runs without errors, but your app isn’t functioning the way you expected. This is **Unexpected Behavior**, and it’s one of the hardest things to debug. The best approach?

    * **Retrace your steps** – review what you asked Lovable to do.

    * **Break it down** – check if a particular section of your implementation is misaligned.

    * **Use images** – show Lovable the UI result versus what you expected.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Writing Better Prompts: Start with a Strong Foundation">
    Many issues can be avoided with a well-structured prompt. Instead of jumping straight into features, follow this **best practice** format:

    1. **Project Overview** – Describe what you’re building.

    2. **Page Structure** – List the key pages and components.

    3. **Navigation Logic** – Explain how users will move through the app.

    4. **Screenshots/Wireframes** – Upload visuals if available.

    5. **Implementation Order** – Specify logical steps, e.g., “Start by creating pages and layout before adding Supabase.”
  </Step>

  <Step title="Follow the Right Implementation Order">
    If you structure your project build logically, it reduces the risk of errors down the line. Stick to this recommended workflow:

    1. **Create pages and layout**

    2. **Integrate Supabase for backend/database functionality**

    3. **Implement authentication (Auth) and user roles**

    4. **Plan out and sequence features**

    5. **Start prompting for feature implementation**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Using the Chat-Only Mode for Debugging">
    When you're unsure about how to structure your prompts or debug an issue, switch to **Chat-Only Mode**:

    * Ask Lovable to **review** what you’re trying to do.

    * Request Lovable to **list the solutions it has already attempted**.

    * Get Lovable to **suggest a different approach** if you’re stuck in an error loop.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Advanced Troubleshooting: What If You’re Still Stuck?">
    If the **Try to Fix** button isn't solving your problem, and you're not making progress, try these:

    * **Be more specific** – Describe exactly what’s wrong, including what you expected versus what happened.

    * **Use images** – Screenshots clarify UI-based issues.

    * **Ask Lovable for debugging help** – Example: *“What solutions have we tried so far? What else can we do?”*

    * **Revert to a previous working state** – If things spiral out of control, go back and implement methodically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Debugging Specific Issues">
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="For UI-related problems:">
        * Use screenshots to show the AI how things render incorrectly.

        * Ask Lovable: *“Explain why this UI behaves this way. What’s the best fix?”*

        * If Try to Fix doesn’t work, try tweaking component structures.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="For API integration issues:">
        * Double-check that you’re using the latest API schema.

        * Ensure Supabase (or any backend) is correctly connected before calling data.

        * Ask Lovable: *“What API methods are being used? Are they correctly formatted?”*
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="When completely stuck:">
        * Prompt: *“Take a step back. Analyze the error and suggest a different approach.”*

        * Break the task into smaller parts instead of solving everything at once.

        * Use the revert button if errors persist.

## Debugging Prompts 101

This guidebook was shared in our community Discord—it might be useful for debugging your project:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Error Fixing">
    When fixing errors, focus exclusively on the relevant code sections without modifying unrelated functioning parts. Analyze the error message and trace it to its source. Implement targeted fixes that address the specific issue while maintaining compatibility with the existing codebase. Before confirming any solution, validate that it resolves the original problem without introducing new bugs. Always preserve working functionality and avoid rewriting code that isn't directly related to the error.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Code Modification Approach">
    When modifying existing code, use a surgical approach that changes only what's necessary to implement the requested feature or fix. Preserve variable names, coding patterns, and architectural decisions present in the codebase. Before suggesting changes, analyze dependencies to ensure modifications won't break existing functionality. Present changes as minimal diffs rather than complete rewrites. When improvements beyond the immediate task are identified, suggest them separately without implementing them automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Database Integration">
    Before suggesting new database structures, thoroughly examine the existing schema to identify tables, relationships, and fields already present. Leverage existing tables whenever possible rather than duplicating data models. When modifications to the database are necessary, ensure they're compatible with existing queries and data access patterns. Consider migration strategies for schema changes that preserve existing data. Always verify foreign key relationships and data integrity constraints before proposing changes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Thorough Issue Analysis">
    Approach every issue with a comprehensive diagnostic process. Begin by gathering all relevant information through careful examination of error messages, logs, and system behavior. Form multiple hypotheses about potential causes rather than jumping to conclusions. Test each hypothesis methodically until the root cause is identified. Document your analysis process and findings before proposing solutions. Consider potential edge cases and how they might affect the system.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Solution Verification">
    Before confirming any solution, implement a rigorous verification process. Test the solution against the original issue to confirm it resolves the problem. Check for unintended side effects in related functionality. Ensure performance isn't negatively impacted. Verify compatibility with different environments and configurations. Run through edge cases to ensure robustness. Only after completing this verification should you present the solution as confirmed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Code Consistency">
    Maintain consistency with the existing codebase in terms of style, patterns, and approaches. Analyze the code to identify naming conventions, formatting preferences, and architectural patterns. Follow these established patterns when implementing new features or fixes. Use the same error handling strategies, logging approaches, and testing methodologies present in the project. This preserves readability and maintainability while reducing the cognitive load for developers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Progressive Enhancement">
    When adding new features, build upon the existing architecture rather than introducing completely new paradigms. Identify extension points in the current design and leverage them for new functionality. Implement changes that align with the established patterns and principles of the codebase. Focus on backward compatibility to ensure existing features continue to work as expected. Document how new additions integrate with and extend the existing system.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Documentation and Explanation">
    Provide clear, concise explanations for all changes and recommendations. Explain not just what changes are being made, but why they're necessary and how they work. Document any assumptions or dependencies involved in the solution. Include comments in code when introducing complex logic or non-obvious solutions. When suggesting architectural changes, provide diagrams or high-level explanations that help visualize the impact.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Technical Debt Awareness">
    Recognize when solutions might introduce technical debt and be transparent about these trade-offs. When time constraints necessitate less-than-ideal solutions, clearly identify what aspects would benefit from future refactoring. Distinguish between quick fixes and proper solutions, recommending the appropriate approach based on context. When technical debt is unavoidable, document it clearly to facilitate future improvements.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Learning and Adaptation">
    Continuously adapt to the project's specific patterns and preferences. Pay attention to feedback on previous suggestions and incorporate these learnings into future recommendations. Build a mental model of the application architecture that becomes increasingly accurate over time. Remember past issues and solutions to avoid repeating mistakes. Actively seek to understand the underlying business requirements driving technical decisions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Preventing Duplicate Components">
    Before creating new pages, components, or flows, conduct a thorough inventory of existing elements in the codebase. Search for similar functionality using relevant keywords and file patterns. Identify opportunities to reuse or extend existing components rather than creating duplicates. When similar features exist, analyze them to understand if they can be parameterized or adapted instead of duplicated. Maintain a mental model of the application's structure to recognize when proposed solutions might create redundant elements. When similar pages or flows are needed, consider creating abstracted components that can be reused with different data or configurations, promoting DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Dead Code Elimination">
    Actively identify and remove unused code rather than letting it accumulate. When replacing functionality, cleanly remove the old implementation instead of simply commenting it out or leaving it alongside new code. Before deleting code, verify its usage throughout the application by checking for imports and references. Use tools like dependency analysis when available to confirm code is truly unused. When refactoring, track deprecated methods and ensure they're properly removed once no longer referenced. Regularly scan for orphaned components, unused imports, commented-out blocks, and unreachable conditions. When suggesting code removal, provide clear reasoning for why it's considered dead code and confirm there are no subtle dependencies before deletion. Maintain cleanliness in the codebase by prioritizing elimination of code paths that are no longer executed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Preserving Working Features">
    Treat working features as locked systems that require explicit permission to modify. Before suggesting changes to any functioning component, clearly identify its boundaries and dependencies. Never remove or substantially alter features that are currently operational without explicit direction. When errors occur in one area, avoid making "just in case" changes to unrelated working components. Maintain a clear understanding of which parts of the application are stable and which are under development. Use a feature-focused approach where changes are isolated to specific feature sets without bleeding into others. When modifying shared components used by multiple features, ensure all dependent features continue functioning as expected. Create safeguards by thoroughly documenting cross-feature dependencies before making modifications that might affect them. Always explicitly confirm intent before suggesting changes to established, functional parts of the application.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Deep Problem-Solving Approach">
    When encountering complex errors, resist the temptation to apply immediate fixes without deeper understanding. Take a deliberate step back to examine the problem from multiple perspectives before proposing solutions. Consider fundamentally different approaches rather than minor variations of the same strategy. Document at least three potential solutions with their pros and cons before recommending a specific approach. Question initial assumptions about the cause of errors, especially when standard fixes don't work. Consider unconventional sources of issues such as environment configurations, external dependencies, or race conditions that might not be immediately obvious. Try reversing your thinking: instead of asking "why isn't this working?", ask "under what conditions would this behavior actually make sense?". Break complex problems into smaller components that can be verified independently. Implement targeted debugging strategies such as logging, breakpoints, or state tracing to gather more information when the source of an error remains unclear. Be willing to propose experimental fixes as learning opportunities rather than definitive solutions when dealing with particularly obscure issues.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Database Query Verification">
    Before suggesting any database query or schema modification, always verify the current state of the database first. Examine existing tables, fields, and relationships to ensure you're not recommending the creation of elements that already exist. When suggesting queries, first check if similar queries exist in the codebase that can be adapted. Review existing data models, migration files, and schema definitions to build an accurate understanding of the database structure. For any proposed table creation, explicitly confirm that the table doesn't already exist and explain why a new table is necessary rather than modifying an existing one. When suggesting field additions, verify that similar fields don't already serve the same purpose under different names. Consider database performance implications of suggested queries and provide optimized alternatives when appropriate. Always contextualize query suggestions within the existing database architecture rather than treating them as isolated operations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="UI Consistency and Theming">
    Maintain strict adherence to the established design system and color palette throughout the application. Before creating new UI components, study existing ones to understand the visual language, spacing patterns, interaction models, and theming approach. When implementing new interfaces, reuse existing component patterns rather than creating visual variations. Extract color values, typography, spacing, and other design tokens from the existing codebase rather than introducing new values. Ensure consistent handling of states (hover, active, disabled, error, etc.) across all components. Respect the established responsive behavior patterns when implementing new layouts. When suggesting UI improvements, ensure they enhance rather than disrupt the visual cohesion of the application. Maintain accessibility standards consistently across all components, including color contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support. Document any component variations and their appropriate usage contexts to facilitate consistent application. When introducing new visual elements, explicitly demonstrate how they integrate with and complement the existing design system rather than standing apart from it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Systematic Debugging Approach">
    When encountering errors, adopt a scientific debugging methodology rather than making random changes. Start by reproducing the exact issue in a controlled environment. Gather comprehensive data including console logs, network requests, component state, and error messages. Form multiple hypotheses about potential causes and test each systematically. Isolate the problem by narrowing down affected components and identifying trigger conditions. Document your debugging process and findings for future reference. Use appropriate debugging tools including browser developer tools, React DevTools, and code-level debugging techniques. Always verify that your solution completely resolves the issue without introducing new problems or regressions elsewhere in the application.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Type Safety and Data Validation">
    Before implementing any functionality, thoroughly analyze type definitions from both database schema and TypeScript interfaces. Maintain strict type checking throughout the codebase, avoiding 'any' type as an escape hatch. When working with data transformations, verify type safety at each step of the pipeline. Pay special attention to common type mismatches like database numbers coming in as strings, date parsing requirements, and handling of nullable fields. Implement consistent naming conventions between database columns and TypeScript interfaces. Document complex type relationships and special handling requirements. Test with real data shapes and verify edge cases, particularly null/undefined handling. When errors occur, trace the data transformation pipeline to identify exactly where types diverge and suggest fixes that maintain type safety.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data Flow Management">
    Conceptualize data flow as a complete pipeline from database through API and state to UI. When implementing features, carefully track how data is transformed at each stage. Implement proper query invalidation patterns to ensure UI remains synchronized with database state. Add strategic console logs at critical points to monitor data transitions. Create clear mental models of when and how data should update in response to actions. Pay careful attention to caching strategies and potential stale data issues. When debugging flow problems, methodically follow the data journey from source to destination. Check timing issues, race conditions, and transformation errors. Verify that the final data shape reaching components matches what they expect. Implement robust error boundaries and loading state management to maintain UI stability during data flow disruptions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance Optimization">
    Monitor application performance proactively rather than waiting for issues to become severe. Review query caching strategies to minimize unnecessary database calls. Check for and eliminate unnecessary component re-renders through proper memoization and dependency management. Analyze data fetching patterns for potential N+1 query problems, excessive waterfalls, or redundant requests. Implement virtualization for long lists and paginate large data sets. Optimize bundle size through code splitting and lazy loading. Compress and optimize assets including images. Use appropriate performance measurement tools to identify bottlenecks including React DevTools, Performance tab, Network panel, and Memory profiler. Focus optimization efforts on metrics that directly impact user experience such as load times, time to interactive, and UI responsiveness. Implement targeted performance improvements rather than premature optimization.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error Management and Resilience">
    Implement a comprehensive error handling strategy that maintains application stability while providing meaningful feedback. Use try/catch blocks strategically around potentially problematic code sections. Create a hierarchy of error boundaries to contain failures within specific components rather than crashing the entire application. Design graceful degradation patterns where components can continue functioning with limited data. Provide clear, user-friendly error messages that explain the problem without technical jargon. Implement recovery mechanisms including retry logic, fallbacks, and state resets. Maintain robust error logging that captures sufficient context for debugging while respecting privacy. Test error scenarios thoroughly to ensure recovery mechanisms work as expected. When suggesting solutions, ensure they address the root cause rather than merely suppressing symptoms, and verify they work across all relevant environments and edge cases.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Component Architecture">
    Approach component design with a clear understanding of component hierarchy and responsibilities. Visualize components as a family tree with proper parent-child relationships. Minimize prop drilling by strategically using context or state management where appropriate. Implement clear boundaries between container (smart) and presentational (dumb) components. Establish consistent patterns for component communication including parent-child and sibling interactions. When debugging component issues, analyze the complete component tree, prop flow, state location, and event handler connections. Design components with single responsibility and clear interfaces. Document component relationships and dependencies to facilitate future maintenance. Implement performance optimizations including memoization, lazy loading, and code splitting where beneficial. Maintain a balance between component reusability and specialization to avoid both duplication and over-abstraction.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="API Integration and Network Management">
    Approach API integration with a comprehensive strategy for requests, responses, and error handling. Verify authentication headers, parameters, and body format for each request. Implement proper error handling for all network operations with specific catches for different error types. Ensure consistent typing between request payloads, expected responses, and application state. Configure proper CORS settings and verify they work across all environments. Implement intelligent retry mechanisms for transient failures with exponential backoff. Consider rate limiting implications and implement appropriate throttling. Add strategic request caching to improve performance and reduce server load. Monitor network performance including request timing and payload sizes. Test API integrations against both happy paths and various failure scenarios. Maintain clear documentation of all API endpoints, their purposes, expected parameters, and response formats to facilitate future development and debugging.

</AccordionGroup>

### GitHub Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why are my recent commits not showing up in my Lovable project?">
    If you notice that your recent commits are missing from your Lovable project, it could be because the commits were made to a different branch on GitHub. Lovable currently only tracks commits made to the default branch (usually <code>main</code> or <code>master</code>). If you’ve been working on a new branch and haven’t merged it into the default branch, those commits won’t be picked up by Lovable.

    <b>To ensure your commits are tracked:</b>

    1. Merge your changes into the default branch.

    2. If you’re working on a new branch, consider switching back to the default branch for commits you want to appear in Lovable.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### API Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection and Authentication Issues">
    If you encounter difficulties connecting or authenticating with integrations, try the following:

    <ol>
      <li>Double-check API credentials for accuracy.</li>
      <li>Ensure the required scopes or permissions are enabled.</li>
      <li>Verify network connectivity, as firewalls or proxies may block connections.</li>
    </ol>

    Refer to <a href="https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration">GitHub Integration</a> or
    <a href="https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase">Supabase Integration</a> for detailed setup instructions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="API Credential Management">
    Lovable enables secure storage of API keys within your project settings (accessible from the <b>Settings</b> sidebar). To maintain security:

    <ul>
      <li>Store your keys in this designated secure location.</li>
      <li>Avoid sharing them with others or using them in prompts unless absolutely necessary.</li>
    </ul>

    This ensures your credentials are protected and reduces the risk of misuse.
  </Accordion>

## Comprehensive Debugging Manual

[This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dfIy5rtkPN9Zi4smX1VAbfbhAiEyBvVw8p7B8kJiEVs/edit?tab=t.0) was created by a Discord community member who has mastered the AI space, ensuring minimal edits are needed.

### Instructions

1. **Download** the file as Markdown and name it: `Comprehensive_Debugging_Manual.md`.

2. **Upload** it to your project’s GitHub repository.

3. **Prompt Lovable** with the following message:*"Read this document - `Comprehensive_Debugging_Manual.md`. Let me know if it helps you. Then, create a prompt that I should use to troubleshoot this issue: \{paste the issue}."*

4. When Lovable provides a prompt or suggested fix, paste it into the chat and append the following:*“Before you proceed, explain in great detail: Why do you think this will work? Wait for my approval.”*

This ensures a thorough debugging process and deeper understanding before implementing any solution.
