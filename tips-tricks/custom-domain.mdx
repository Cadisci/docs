When you create a project, Lovable makes it easy to [publish it](../features/deploy) with the click of a button.

By default, your Lovable app is accessible via a Lovable staging subdomain (e.g., `yoursite.lovable.app`). However, you can connect your site to a custom domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`) or a subdomain (e.g., `subdomain.yourdomain.com`) that you own.

Using a custom domain enhances your brand, improves [SEO](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/seo) discoverability, and makes your site easier to find and remember.

If you want to have a custom domain, see below.

## Using Netlify

You can host on Netlify for free with a custom domain.

### Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1">
    Ensure that your project is successfully transferred to GitHub. In the Lovable editor, click on "Transfer to GitHub" located in the top right corner.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 2">
    Head over to Netlify and log in using your GitHub credentials.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 3">
    In Netlify, you'll need to follow these simple steps: Click on "Import from Git" > Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub repositories > Select your Lovable repository from the provided list > Click "Deploy"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 4">
    Let's proceed to configure your custom domain directly within Netlify: Go to "Domain Management" > Click "Add a domain" > Enter your domain name > Click "Verify" > Follow the DNS configuration prompts
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 5">
    Your Lovable app will automatically redeploy to Netlify whenever you make changes in Lovable.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>You will need to bring an existing domain or purchase one.</Note>

## Using Vercel

### Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Github repository">
    Open your project in Lovable and click GitHub then "create repository" if you haven't already done so. This will commit your code to the `main` branch and create a repository. Once you do this, all changes made to code in your app will automatically be commited to your Github repository on each change.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up Vercel">
    Go to the [Vercel website](https://vercel.com/) and create an account. Configure your domain and set the necessary GitHub permissions (make sure to handle DNS settings properly).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Automatic deployments">
    Vercel will automatically deploy the latest changes from the `main` branch each time it is updated. You can make one or two small changes to your app on Lovable and then visit Vercel deployments to ensure updates are being redeployed from `main`. Once confirmed, do the next step:
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Development branch">
    In your GitHub repository settings in Lovable, commit all new changes to a second branch called `dev` (or whatever you want).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Vercel Builds">
    Go back to Vercel and adjust your settings to ensure it only builds production deployments from the `main` branch.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make changes in Development">
    Work on your app in the Lovable. Any changes will go to the `dev` branch now and wont automatically be deployed via Vercel.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy new changes">
    When you're ready to push new changes to your domain, go to GitHub and perform a pull request from `dev` to `main`. Once you complete and merge the pull request, Vercel will automatically deploy the updates in about one minute.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Notes

* If you hit the 100/day deployment limit in Vercel (it builds your `dev` branch but doesn't deploy it). You can ask Lovable chat to build you vercel.json file which will force Vercel to not build development builds at all.

* **Supabase Consideration**: Currently, you can only utilize one Supabase instance. So, if you make extensive SQL changes, it could potentially break production. Unfortunately, we can't yet provide specific guidelines for this scenario as it's complex. Frequently test your production environment if you make changes related to Supabase.

## Using Namecheap

### Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Advanced DNS Settings">
    Navigate to the [Advanced DNS](https://ap.www.namecheap.com/Domains/DomainControlPanel/mysimpledomain.com/advancedns) settings for your domain.

    Add the following DNS records to your domain configuration:

    ![DNS record](/images/dns-record.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up GitHub Workflow">
    Create a GitHub workflow file for deployment:

    ```
    name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

    on:
      workflow_dispatch:

    jobs:
      deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3

          - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
            with:
              node-version: '18'

          - run: npm install

          - run: npm run build

          - name: Copy index.html to 404.html
            run: cp dist/index.html dist/404.html

          - name: Debug build output
            run: |
              echo "Listing contents of the root directory..."
              ls -la
              echo "Listing contents of the dist directory..."
              ls -R dist

          - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
            uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
            with:
              github_token: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
              publish_dir: ./dist
              cname: mysimpledomain.com
              force_orphan: true
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate GitHub Access Token">
    Create a classic token at [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens):

    Keep the token page openâ€”you'll need it for the next step.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Repository Secret">
    Add your token as a repository secret namedÂ `GH_PAT`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure GitHub Pages">
    Navigate to your repository's GitHub Pages settings and:

    * SelectÂ Build from a branch

    * Choose theÂ gh-pagesÂ branch

    * Save the settings
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the GitHub Workflow">
    Your website will be updated each time you run the GitHub workflow:

    1. Go to your repository's Actions page

    2. Select theÂ Deploy to GitHub PagesÂ workflow

    3. ClickÂ Run workflowÂ button

    4. This will publish the latest version of your GitHub repository to your custom domain
  </Step>

  <Step title="You're All Set! ðŸŽ‰ ">
    Your Lovable app is now available on your custom domain.
  </Step>
</Steps>
