When you create a project, Lovable makes it easy to [publish it](../features/deploy) with the click of a button.

By default, your Lovable app is accessible via a Lovable staging subdomain (e.g., `yoursite.lovable.app`). However, you can connect your site to a custom domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`) or a subdomain (e.g., `subdomain.yourdomain.com`) that you own.

Using a custom domain enhances your brand, improves [SEO](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/seo) discoverability, and makes your site easier to find and remember.

If you want to have a custom domain, see below.

## How to Connect a Custom Domain

To connect a custom domain, navigate to **Project > Settings > Domains** in Lovable.

### Requirements

* A **paid Lovable plan** is required to connect a custom domain.

* You **must own** a domain before proceeding. If you don’t have one, you can purchase it from a domain provider such as:

  * [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com)

  * [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com)

  * [View full list of domain providers](https://developers.entri.com/provider-list)

Lovable uses [**Entri**](https://www.entri.com/) to facilitate quick and seamless domain connections.

  <Accordion title="My custom domain is connected, but my site isn’t live. What should I do?">
    DNS propagation can take up to **48 hours** due to factors such as TTL (Time to Live) and internet service provider delays. If your site isn’t live yet:

    * Wait a bit longer for DNS changes to fully update.

    * Use a tool like [whatsmydns](https://www.whatsmydns.net/) to check the status of your DNS records.

    * Clear your browser cache to ensure you’re viewing the latest version of your site.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My site isn’t appearing after 48 hours. What now?">
    * Double-check that your **DNS records** are correctly set in your domain provider’s settings.

    * If issues persist, contact your **domain provider’s support team**.

    * If your DNS settings are correct but the site still doesn’t load, reach out to **Lovable’s customer support** for assistance.

  <Accordion title="Can I buy a domain through Lovable?">
    For this launch, Lovable will **not** support buying domains. We may launch domain purchasing later if these issues are resolved.

## Using Netlify

You can host on Netlify for free with a custom domain.

The steps are:

1. Ensure that your project is successfully transferred to GitHub. In the Lovable editor, click on "Transfer to GitHub" located in the top right corner.

2. Head over to Netlify and log in using your GitHub credentials.

3. In Netlify, you'll need to follow these simple steps: Click on "Import from Git" > Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub repositories > Select your Lovable repository from the provided list > Click "Deploy"

4. Let's proceed to configure your custom domain directly within Netlify: Go to "Domain Management" > Click "Add a domain" > Enter your domain name > Click "Verify" > Follow the DNS configuration prompts

5. Your Lovable app will automatically redeploy to Netlify whenever you make changes in Lovable.

<Note>You will need to bring an existing domain or purchase one.</Note>

## Using Vercel

1. **Create a Github repository**: Open your project in Lovable and click GitHub then "create repository" if you haven't already done so. This will commit your code to the `main` branch and create a repository. Once you do this, all changes made to code in your app will automatically be commited to your Github repository on each change.

2. **Set up Vercel**: Go to the [Vercel website](https://vercel.com/) and create an account. Configure your domain and set the necessary GitHub permissions (make sure to handle DNS settings properly).

3. **Automatic deployments**: Vercel will automatically deploy the latest changes from the `main` branch each time it is updated. You can make one or two small changes to your app on Lovable and then visit Vercel deployments to ensure updates are being redeployed from `main`. Once confirmed, do the next step:

4. **Create a Development branch**: In your GitHub repository settings in Lovable, commit all new changes to a second branch called `dev` (or whatever you want).

5. **Configure Vercel Builds**: Go back to Vercel and adjust your settings to ensure it only builds production deployments from the `main` branch.

1. **Make changes in Development**: Work on your app in the Lovable. Any changes will go to the `dev` branch now and wont automatically be deployed via Vercel.

2. **Deploy new changes**: When you're ready to push new changes to your domain, go to GitHub and perform a pull request from `dev` to `main`. Once you complete and merge the pull request, Vercel will automatically deploy the updates in about one minute.

### Notes:

* If you hit the 100/day deployment limit in Vercel (it builds your `dev` branch but doesn't deploy it). You can ask Lovable chat to build you vercel.json file which will force Vercel to not build development builds at all.

* **Supabase Consideration**: Currently, you can only utilize one Supabase instance. So, if you make extensive SQL changes, it could potentially break production. Unfortunately, we can't yet provide specific guidelines for this scenario as it's complex. Frequently test your production environment if you make changes related to Supabase.
