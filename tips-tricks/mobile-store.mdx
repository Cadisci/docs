## Workaround Playbook

This is the playbook for publishing a Lovable Web App to Both App Stores, Apple App Store and Google Play Store:

<Warning>
  This is a workaround, nothing official on our side or native integration for mobile support.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepping the App">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Step 1">
        Finalize the app’s UI and features inside Lovable.dev, ensuring everything functioned smoothly on different devices.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Step 2">
        Conduct multiple tests to check responsiveness and performance.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Setting Up Developer Accounts">
    - **Apple App Store:** Register for an Apple Developer Account ($99/year), configured necessary certificates, provisioning profiles, and App IDs.
    - **Google Play Store:** Set up a Google Play Developer Account ($25 one-time fee), ensuring proper API access and compliance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Converting the Web App for Submission">
    Use a web-to-native wrapper to package the Lovable web app for app store submission.

    - For iOS, use Xcode to meet Apple’s strict submission guidelines.
    - For Android, work with Android Studio to test and prepare the app for Play Store approval.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submitting to the App Stores">
    Create detailed App Store and Play Store listings, including descriptions, screenshots, keywords, and privacy policies.

    - Apple’s review process took 48-72 hours before approval.
    - Google Play approval was much faster—less than 24 hours.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Post-Launch Optimization">
    - Monitore app performance and user feedback to ensure everything ran smoothly.
    - Implement updates and optimizations for better discoverability and engagement.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The process has its challenges, especially with Apple’s strict guidelines and broken link setback, but it is all worth it in the end\\! 

Lovable definitely made the process smoother.
