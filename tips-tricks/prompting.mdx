  **What is prompting?**

  Prompting is the common term used for textual, natural language inputs used to interact with Lovable. You can think of it as text messages containing instructions you are giving to Lovable.

  Since Lovable relies on large language models (LLMs), prompting strategies impact output quality.

## Prompting strategies

Crafting effective prompts is key to getting the best results from Lovable. Use these tips to build better products, in a shorter amount of time.

### **1. Be clear and specific**

Provide details on what exactly you want Lovable to build.

* **Example**:

  * **Vague**: “Build a dashboard.”

  * **Specific**: “Build a dashboard with 4 components: YTD revenue as large number, Sales revenue per day as a line chart, Number of customers per day as a bar chart, and customer demographics in a pie chart.”

### **2. Provide Context**

Helping Lovable understand what you are trying to achieve enables it to stay a step ahead of your latest input.

* **Example**:

  * “I want to build a task management app with features like user auth, project & task creation, task tracking, and task assignments that enables my team to collaborate better.

### **3. Break things down**

For complex projects, divide tasks into smaller, manageable steps.

* **Example**:

  * **Step 1**: “Create a login page with email/password input fields.”

  * **Step 2**: “Add another page: contact form with name, email, and phone fields.”

  * **Step 3**: “Add a button that lets me download a CSV with all stored records.”

### **4. Add Visuals to Guide the AI**

Lovable can read images or screenshots and use them for inspiration or as layout to replicate.&#x20;
***Pro tip:** Break complex layouts down in screenshots of individual components.*

* **Simple Visual Prompt**: “Create a UI similar to this screenshot.”

* **Detailed Visual Prompt**: “Build a kanban board similar to this image, with drag-and-drop functionality for tasks.”

### **5. Reference well-known tools or components to guide the AI**

Images or screenshots, paired with instructions, can clarify design-related prompts.

* **Reference other products**: “Create a Tiktok-style feed to display the news from our database.”

* **Specify components:** Use the Pangea home dnd npm package for drag-and-drop.”

### **6. Add Constraints**

Setting boundaries keeps Lovable focused on essential features.

* **Example**:

  * “Create a to-do app with a max of 3 tasks visible at a time, with add/edit/delete capabilities.”

### **7. Be Specific When Correcting Issues**

Clear error descriptions lead to faster troubleshooting.

* **Generic**: “Nothing works, fix it!”

* **Detailed**: “Screen goes blank after adding a new item. Before the last update, I could see updates without issues. Elaborate why this could be and explore different possibilities to fix it.”

### **8. Give Lovable "room to think through a task"**

Instead of prompting for direct output, AI often delivers better results when asked to structure a problem before finding a solution.

* **Direct output**: “I receive error message X when clicking the "Submit" button. Please fix this.”

* **Structured approach**: “I receive error message X when clicking the "Submit" button. Carefully consider the different problems that could lead to this error and then try to solve them one by one to find the right solution.”

### **9. Use logs for debugging**

For advanced users, sharing console errors helps the AI identify the cause of issues and can help it find solutions.

* **Example with Console Logs**:

  * “App isn’t loading; screen is blank. Console error: `TypeError: Q9() is undefined at /assets/index.js:435:35112`.”

  * Asking Lovable to implement error logging can help generate better logs to feed back via the next prompt.
