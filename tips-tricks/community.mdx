## Feature Requests

This [forum](https://feedback.lovable.dev/) is meant to help community share their feature and integration requests to let the community vote and the Lovable team to consider them for upcoming improvements.

## Launched&#x20;

Weâ€™ve createdÂ [**Lovable Launched**](https://launched.lovable.app/), a platform like Product Hunt, where you canÂ **publish your app to gain visibility**. You can learn more about this program [here](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/deploy#launch-and-get-traffic).

## **Partner Program**

A new initiative that enables users to collaborate with experienced solo builders and agencies to develop products quickly and effectively.

### **Why Use Hire a Lovable Partner?**

* **Get results faster** â€“ Builders use Lovableâ€™s platform to deliver projects in a fraction of the time compared to traditional development cycles.

* **Work with vetted experts** â€“ Each partner is reviewed and approved by Lovable to ensure quality and reliability.

* **Focus on your vision** â€“ The expert handles the technical work while you concentrate on your business growth and strategy.

### **How It Works**

1. [**Submit a request**](https://lovable.dev/)**:** Fill out a simple request form detailing your projectâ€™s needs, desired timeline, and any specific requirements. Weâ€™ll match you with an expert who fits your criteria.

2. [**Browse Experts Directly**](https://lovable.dev/)**:** Browse our curated directory of top-tier **Lovable builders and agencies** and select the one that best aligns with your style and goals.
