<Steps>
      <Step title="AI-Generated Courses">
        To make learning interactive, we implemented an AI-driven course generation system using [OpenAI’s GPT model](). Here's how it works:

        1. Users select a topic (e.g., “Questions to ask at a barbecue”).
        2. Lovable calls an [OpenAI Edge function]() to generate **10 engaging Spanish-language questions**.
        3. Users complete quizzes, track progress, and receive AI feedback on their answers.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Enhancing User Engagement">
        - **Dynamically Generated Questions**: Each quiz is AI-generated, ensuring fresh, unique content every time.
        - **Interactive Feedback**: The AI provides explanations for correct and incorrect answers to improve learning.
        - **Progress Tracking**: Users can save and revisit courses, enhancing retention and practice.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Enhancing Visual Engagement with Replicate">
        To add a visual learning element, we integrated [**Replicate’s Flux Schnell**]() image generation model:

        - **Automated Course Banners**: Every course dynamically generates an image matching the topic.
        - **Visually Immersive Experience**: AI-driven visuals enhance user engagement and retention.
        - **Fast Image Processing**: Using Replicate’s API, images are generated in real time without slowing down the experience.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Real-Time Voice Conversations">
        A major milestone in the app's development was the addition of **real-time Spanish-speaking practice** using [OpenAI’s real-time WebRTC API]() :

        - **Interactive AI Tutor**: Users can speak directly with an AI that dynamically responds in Spanish.
        - **Pronunciation Assistance**: The AI provides real-time corrections and suggestions.
        - **Seamless Conversations**: The natural flow of conversation makes it feel like interacting with a human tutor.
