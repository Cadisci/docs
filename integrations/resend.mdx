In this tutorial, we'll walk through creating a simple yet powerful CRM using Lovable for development, Supabase for data storage, and Resend for email automation. By the end, you'll have a system that collects leads, stores them securely, and allows you to send follow-up emailsâ€”all built in less than an hour.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setting Up the Contact Form in Lovable">
    The first step is to create a landing page with a contact form where users can submit their details.

    ### Instructions:

    1. Open Lovable and create a new project.
    2. Use the AI assistant to generate a simple landing page by prompting: _"Create a SaaS landing page with a contact form collecting name, email, and message."_
    3. Add form validation to ensure proper data entry.

    At this stage, your landing page should include a form that users can fill out. However, we need to store this data somewhere, which leads us to Supabase.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connecting Supabase for Data Storage">
    Supabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase, offering a secure and scalable database for your CRM.

    ### Instructions:

    1. Create a **Supabase** account and start a new project.
    2. In Lovable, connect your Supabase project by adding the **API key**.
    3. Create a database table named `contacts` with columns:
       - `id` (UUID, primary key)
       - `name` (text)
       - `email` (text)
       - `message` (text)
       - `created_at` (timestamp)
    4. Modify the contact form to send form data to Supabase upon submission.

    With this setup, user submissions will be stored securely in Supabase, and we can move on to automating email notifications.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automating Emails with Resend">
    [Resend]() ensures that every new contact receives a confirmation email while allowing us to send follow-up messages later.

    ### Instructions:

    1. Create a **Resend** account.
    2. Verify your domain to improve email deliverability.
    3. Generate an **API key** and integrate it into Lovable.
    4. Modify the submission function to trigger an email confirmation using Resend.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Creating an Admin Dashboard">
    To manage leads efficiently, we need an admin dashboard where authenticated users can view and respond to contacts.

    ### Instructions:

    1. Create an **admin route** in Lovable.
    2. Implement **authentication** with Supabase (email/password login).
    3. Display stored contacts in a **table format** with the following:
       - Contact Name
       - Email
       - Message Preview
       - Date Submitted
    4. Add a **detailed view** panel where clicking on a contact reveals full details.

    Now, only logged-in users can view and manage CRM data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sending Personalized Emails from the Admin Dashboard">
    To streamline communication, we'll add the ability to send custom follow-up emails directly from the admin dashboard.

    ### Instructions:

    1. Add a **text field** and predefined templates (e.g., "Thank you for signing up\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\!" or "Follow-up on your request").
    2. Implement a **send button** that triggers an email using Resend.
    3. Log sent emails in Supabase for future reference.

    Once implemented, you can send quick, personalized emails without leaving the CRM.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adding a Newsletter Subscription Feature">
    A great way to nurture leads is by sending updates via a newsletter. We'll add a subscription form to capture emails.

    ### Instructions:

    1. Add a **newsletter signup form** to the landing page.
    2. Connect the form to **Resend Audiences** to store subscribers.
    3. Set up a simple **broadcast email campaign** to engage subscribers.

    Now, you can send newsletters to all subscribers directly from Resend.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ ">
    Youâ€™ve successfully built a simple CRM that collects leads, sends confirmation emails, allows for admin management, and enables direct email outreachâ€”all in under an hour.
