## Unverified Integrations

All other callable APIs can still be integrated but will often require more context and more instructions.

You can request new integrations [here](https://lovable.featurebase.app/?b=675883fb92175ba92d835f92).

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Connection and Authentication Issues

If you encounter difficulties connecting or authenticating with integrations, try the following:

1. Double-check API credentials for accuracy.

2. Ensure the required scopes or permissions are enabled.

3. Verify network connectivity, as firewalls or proxies may block connections.

Refer to [GitHub Integration](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration) or [Supabase Integration](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase) for detailed setup instructions.

### API Credential Management

Lovable enables secure storage of API keys within your project settings (accessible from the **Settings** sidebar). To maintain security:

* Store your keys in this designated secure location.

* Avoid sharing them with others or using them in prompts unless absolutely necessary.

This ensures your credentials are protected and reduces the risk of misuse.

### Challenges for Non-Developers

If you’re not a developer, integrating APIs might feel overwhelming. Lovable simplifies this with its in-chat configuration. For unsupported APIs, join the [Lovable community on Discord](https://discord.gg/jstGvUnFnm) for help or request new integrations [here](https://feedback.lovable.dev/).

### Edge Function and Configuration Errors

Errors in edge functions can disrupt workflows. To resolve these issues:

1. Review edge function logs to identify and fix errors.

2. Ensure all required dependencies are installed.

3. Confirm that environment variables are correctly configured.

For more information, refer to [Supabase’s edge function examples](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions) for best practices.

### Session and Data Management

Managing sessions and data effectively is critical for smooth app performance. Follow these tips:

* Use [Supabase](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase)’s real-time features (or similar services) for seamless data syncing.

* Ask Lovable to implement strong authentication and token refresh mechanisms for session management.

* Regularly verify that your database schema is up-to-date to prevent potential data integrity issues.

### Repository and Account Management

For smooth repository management and account syncing:

* Verify that [GitHub](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration) repository access permissions are correctly configured.

* Use Lovable’s **built-in rollback feature** for undoing accidental changes, as your projects are automatically backed up.

This ensures safe and reliable version control for your projects.
