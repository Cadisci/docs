## **Why GitHub Matters in Your Dev Lifecycle**

Version control and repository hosting are essential for modern software development. GitHub, one of the most widely adopted platforms, simplifies collaboration, code management, and version tracking.

**TL;DR:**

* **Git** is a version control system that tracks changes in your code.

* **GitHub** hosts your Git repositories, making teamwork effortless.

* **Lovable integrates with GitHub** to back up and sync your project’s source code in real time.

* **Connecting your project to GitHub** ensures transparency, better collaboration, and simplified rollbacks.

## **Lovable’s Built-In GitHub Integration**

Lovable backs every project with a Git repository, making it easy for developers to push commits directly to GitHub. This means:

* **Full Control:** Update your project anytime, without asking the AI.

* **Real-Time Sync:** Every change you push to GitHub is automatically pulled into Lovable, keeping your project up to date.

* **Seamless Collaboration:** Work with your team using GitHub’s built-in features while leveraging Lovable’s AI-powered assistance.

## Getting Started: Connecting Your Project to GitHub

Before pushing your first commit, you need to connect your GitHub account to your Lovable project:

    <source src="/assets/connect-to-github.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1">
    Navigate to **GitHub → Connect to GitHub** within Lovable.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 2">
    You will be redirected to GitHub to authorize the connection.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 3">
    Choose one of the following access options:

    1. **All repositories** (Lovable can create and manage all repos)

    2. **Specific repositories** (Lovable only accesses selected repos)

    Both options will let Lovable create repositories in your GitHub account or organization.

    <Note>
      You can only connect one GitHub login to your Lovable account, but you can
      create repositories in any of the organizations you choose to install the
      Lovable app in.
    </Note>

    <Warning>
      If you’re connecting a project within an **organization**, you’ll need admin access to create a repository.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How Code Changes Work with Lovable and GitHub

Once connected, managing your project becomes effortless:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Making Changes & Viewing Code">
    * Navigate to **GitHub → View on GitHub** to see your repository.

    * Edit directly in **GitHub Codespaces** or clone the repo to your local IDE.

    * Any commit you push will be automatically reflected in Lovable—no manual updates needed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Managing Code with GitHub Features">
    * **Branches & Pull Requests** – Work on new features separately and merge changes seamlessly.

    * **Issues & Project Boards** – Track progress, bugs, and tasks.

    * **Forking & Contributions** – Experiment safely with a copy of the repo before merging.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Automating Workflows">
    * Connect GitHub to CI/CD pipelines for **automated builds & tests**.

    * Link GitHub Issues to commits for a **better development workflow**.

    * Use **GitHub Actions** to trigger deployments when code changes are merged.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### **Real-World Scenarios: Why This Integration Matters**

* **Collaboration Made Simple** – Teams working on a web app can create branches for new features, open pull requests for reviews, and ensure code quality before merging.

* **Bug Fixes in Real-Time** – Track issues in GitHub, push fixes, and see them reflected in Lovable instantly.

* **Scaling with Automation** – Sync changes with CI/CD tools to automate testing and deployment, reducing manual effort.

With Lovable and GitHub working hand in hand, your development process becomes **smarter, faster, and more efficient**.
