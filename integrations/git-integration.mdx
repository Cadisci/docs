To make it easier for developers to work together with the AI on projects, Lovable backs all projects with a git repository and lets you push commits directly to the repository.

In order to push commits to GitHub, your project and Lovable will automatically pull them in and update the project. This allows you to make changes yourself, without asking the AI.

## Connecting a project to your GitHub account

Before pushing your first commit, you will need to connect your GitHub account to the project. You can do this by navigating to **GitHub → Connect to GitHub**. You will then be redirected to GitHub to authorize the connection.

You can choose to either grant access to:

1. All repositories
2. Specific repositories

Both options will let Lovable create repositories in your GitHub account or organization.

<Note>
  You can only connect one GitHub login to your Lovable account, but you can
  create repositories in any of the organizations you choose to install the
  Lovable app in.

<Warning>
  You will need admin access if you are trying to create a repository in an
  organization.

## Making changes to a project through commits

Once you have connected your GitHub account to your project, you can view the source code by navigating to **GitHub → View on GitHub**.

Any change you make and push to the repository will be automatically reflected in Lovable.

You can commit changes directly in GitHub Codespaces or clone the repo to use your preferred IDE.
