## [Lovable.dev Add-ons](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lovabledev-add-ons/kbacddfmjjdomaadfckjdhclgaghmjpi) by Rezaul![](/lovable-add-ons.jpg)

1. **Voice Input Integration**: Real-time voice-to-text transcription, visual feedback while speaking and hands-free prompt building right inside Lovable.

2. **Prompt Library & Prompt Enhancer**: Pre-built prompts for frequent tasks (like fixing mobile layout overflow or adding meta tags), Groq AI integration (DeepSeek Llama 70B, Mixtral 8x7B, Gemma2 9B, and LLaMA 3.3 70B), and a “system prompt” approach that structures outputs in a consistent, reliable way.

3. **Project Management**: Custom folders to organize multiple Lovable projects, drag-and-drop functionality for rearranging projects and quick navigation when you have 50+ active builds (like me!)

4. **Advanced Chat Search**: Efficiently filter and locate specific messages, perfect for teams who rely on Lovable for brainstorming or project discussions.

5. **Smart Color Picker**: Grab colors directly off the canvas, save custom palettes and copy color codes in HEX, RGB, HSL—great for designers.

6. **SEO Tools**: Quick meta tag generation and validation, easy insertion of meta titles, descriptions, and social previews saving you the hassle of editing them manually in code.
