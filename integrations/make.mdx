In this tutorial, we'll walk through building a **custom CRM** (Customer Relationship Management system) using **Lovable** and **Make**. The goal is to create a functional CRM with:

- **Deal tracking** (drag-and-drop functionality)
- **Contact management** (modal views for editing)
- **AI-powered calling** (using Vapi and Make)
- **Company data enrichment** (using [Apollo.io](http://Apollo.io))

By the end, youâ€™ll have a **customized CRM** that automates workflows without needing to code from scratch.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setting Up Your CRM in Lovable">
    - Go to [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) and create a new project.
    - Set the project type as **CRM**.
    - Define key entities:
      - **Deals** (for tracking sales progress)
      - **Contacts** (representing potential clients)
      - **Companies** (the organizations you're interacting with)
    - Select **Light Theme** (optional).
    - Click **Generate**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adding Deal Stages">
    1. Open the **Deals** section in Lovable.
    2. Click **Edit** and introduce five stages:
       - **Lead**
       - **Qualification**
       - **Proposal Sent**
       - **Negotiation**
       - **Closed - Won/Lost**
    3. Enable **Drag-and-Drop** functionality for deals to move across stages.

    <Info>
      **Why?** This allows users to track deals in a visual workflow.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implementing a Contact Management System">
    - Click on the **Contacts** section.
    - Modify the UI to include a **clickable modal view** when selecting a contact.
    - Ensure that:
      - The modal displays **contact details**.
      - Fields are **editable** for easy updates.

    <Info>
      **Why?** Traditional CRMs redirect users to a new page, slowing down workflow. A modal keeps everything in place.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adding an AI-Powered Call Feature">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Connect Lovable to Make">
        - Open [Make](https://www.make.com/) and create a **new scenario**.
        - Add a **Webhook** module:
          - Click **Webhooks \> Custom Webhook**.
          - Name it **Call Contact**.
          - Copy the webhook URL.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure Lovable to Send Call Data">
        - In Lovable, go to **Call Contact**.
        - Modify the buttonâ€™s action to **send JSON data** (name, phone number, company, and call goal) to the Make webhook.
        - Test the connection by clicking **Call Contact**.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Use Vapi for AI-Powered Calling">
        - In Make, add an **API Call module**.
        - Configure it to send the call request to [Vapi](https://vapi.ai/).
        - Set up a **Vapi AI agent** to:
          - Call the contact.
          - Read a custom script based on the deal stage.
          - Log call results in Lovable.

        <Info>
          Now, when clicking **Call Contact**, an AI agent will make the call on your behalf.
        </Info>
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adding Company Enrichment with Apollo.io">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Setup Make Webhook for Enrichment">
        - In Make, create another **Webhook** named **Enrich Company**.
        - Copy the webhook URL.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Modify Lovable to Send Enrichment Requests">
        - Add an **Enrich Company** button in the **Companies** section.
        - Modify its action to **send the domain name** as a JSON request to Make.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure Apollo API in Make">
        - Add an **API Call module** in Make.
        - Use the [**Apollo.io**](http://Apollo.io)\*\* Organization Enrichment API\*\*.
        - Pass the **company domain** to get:
          - Industry
          - Number of employees
          - Company address
          - Funding details

        <Info>
          Now, clicking **Enrich Company** fetches real-time company data.
        </Info>
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Making the Data More Readable">
    To structure the API response:

    - Modify Lovable to dynamically parse the JSON response.
    - Display results in a structured **modal view**.

    <Info>
      **Why?** Raw JSON isnâ€™t user-friendly. This ensures clean, readable data.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Securing API Calls with Supabase">
    To hide API calls using Supabase Edge Functions:

    - In Lovable, enable **Supabase integration**.
    - Create an **Edge Function** to proxy requests to Make.
    - Modify Lovable to call the **Edge Function** instead of Makeâ€™s webhook.

    <Info>
      **Why?** This prevents unauthorized access to your webhook.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automating Follow-Ups and Workflows">
    To automate Email campaigns based on Deal stages:

    - In Make, add an **Email module**.
    - Trigger email automation when:
      - A deal moves to the **Proposal Sent** stage.
      - A contact **opens an email**.

    <Info>
      This keeps sales reps informed and automates customer engagement.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Final Testing and Deployment">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Test Your CRM">
        - Add a **test deal** and move it through the pipeline.
        - Add a **contact** and trigger a call.
        - Enrich a **companyâ€™s details** and verify data.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Deploy and Share">
        - Use **Lovableâ€™s Custom Domain feature** to personalize your CRM.
        - Share the app with your team.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
