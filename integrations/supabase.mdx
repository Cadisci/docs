    2. You will be redirected to a page where you will be able to select the relevant organisation.
    3. You will be then redirected back to Lovable, where you will need to select the relevant project within that organisation.

    After completing these steps, you will have to wait some seconds for your Supabase integration to finish. Look at the chat for this confirmation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adding Authentication with Supabase

This section details how to integrate the Supabase Authentication service into your Lovable project, providing specific guidelines for setup and usage.

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LHpMUj-Jf_k" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen />

### Initial setup

To initiate authentication, ensure that you have already connected Supabase project to your Lovable project.

To add a basic login page to your project, simply run a prompt similar to the one below.

<Note>
  Example prompt:

  ```
  Add login
  ```
</Note>

You can then create a user by either:

- Creating a user directly via the Supabase Dashboard by navigating Supabase -> Authentication -> Users -> Add user.
- Signing up via the login page you've added

We recommend that you disable the email verification step for now, which you can do in Supabase -> Authentication -> Providers -> Email -> Disable "Confirm email".

### Adding Google Authentication

In order to start building UI that uses your data stored in Supabase simply:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1">
    Ask Lovable to create a new feature and that you expect the data to be stored in Supabase.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2">
    Lovable will then provide you with a SQL snippet that you can run in the SQL editor in Supabase to create the table(s).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3">
    Once you confirm that you have run the SQL snippet, then Lovable will update the UI to allow you to interact with the data stored in Supabase.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Storing secrets with Supabase

If you are connected to Supabase, secret keys can be added to Lovable in two ways:

1. In the project settings.
2. In the chat if you ask it to show the secrets form.

These keys will be stored safely in Supabase's edge function secret manager.
These keys will be used when running Edge Functions and will let them connect to services as OpenAI, Stripe, Anthropic and more.

## Edge Functions with Supabase

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p_hKIDlxXp0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen />

You can also use Edge Functions to add powerful backend features like:

- Using AI to enhance your app's capabilities
- Sending emails to your users
- Processing payments
- Running scheduled tasks

Lovable will write and deploy Edge Functions to your Supabase project when implementing backend functionality.

When troublehsooting, you  can visit the the logs for your Edge Function in Supabase -> Functions -> Logs.

<Warning>
  Important Note: Before you deploy your app to production or use any real data, you will need to review and set up the appropriate RLS policies. Lovable can help with that.
