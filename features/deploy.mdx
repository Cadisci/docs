Once your web app is ready, you can **deploy it** and share it with the world. You also have the option to **share a work-in-progress version** to gather feedback before going live. Lovable makes it simple to publish, iterate, and distribute your applications with just a few clicks.

<Tip>
  Your published app will be accessible to anyone with the link. Make sure
  you're ready to share before publishing!
</Tip>

## Publishing your app

When your project is ready, **publish it to generate a shareable URL.** This makes it easy to showcase your application or share it with collaborators and stakeholders.

1. Once deployment is complete, you’ll see a **Republish** button for future updates.

Your application is now live, and you can access it via the provided link.

<Note>
  1. The publishing process typically takes less than a minute. You'll receive a
     notification once it's complete.

  2. We've added an option in the project settings to show or hide the Lovable badge on your deployed app. You can customize this setting before publishing.

## Previewing Your App

Previewing allows you to **see your latest changes** without affecting the live, published version.

<Info>
  **Use previewing for iterative development**

  Previewing is very handy as it allows you and others to view the latest changes without affecting the live, published version of your application.

  We've noticed users using it for iterative development and getting real-time feedback, as well as for collaborative reviews and testing before final deployment.
</Info>

To preview:

1. Open the **Share** dialog.

2. Locate the **Preview** section.

3. Click the generated **preview link** to view or share your work-in-progress updates.

The preview link is generated instantly and can be shared with team members for feedback.
