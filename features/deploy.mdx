Once your web app is ready, you can deploy it or share it with the world. You can also share your work-in-progress version to gather feedback. Lovable makes it simple to publish and share your apps with just a few clicks.&#x20;

<Tip>
  Your published app will be accessible to anyone with the link. Make sure
  you're ready to share before publishing!
</Tip>

## Publishing your app

To publish your web app, in the top right corner of the editor view, click on the **Share** button. This button looks like a globe icon.

<Frame>
  <img src="/assets/share-icon.png" alt="Share icon in Lovable" />
</Frame>

After clicking the **Share** button, a dialog will appear with options to publish your application. Click the green **Publish** button to start the deployment process. During this time, the button will display **Publishing**.

<Frame>
  <video autoPlay controls loop muted>
    <source src="/assets/videos/video-publish-republish.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</Frame>

Once the deployment is complete, the dialog will show the published address with a **Republish** button for future updates.

Your application is now live, and you can access it at the provided link.

<Note>
  1. The publishing process typically takes less than a minute. You'll receive a
     notification once it's complete.

  2. We've added an option in the project settings to show or hide the Lovable badge on your deployed app. You can customize this setting before publishing.

## Previewing your app

Previewing your app allows you to preview and share your work-in-progress updates without fully deploying them.

<Info>
  **Use previewing for iterative development**

  Previewing is very handy as it allows you and others to view the latest changes without affecting the live, published version of your application.

  We've noticed users using it for iterative development and getting real-time feedback, as well as for collaborative reviews and testing before final deployment.
</Info>

Within the same **Share** dialog described earlier, you'll see a **Preview** section with a link to view or share your work-in-progress updates.

The preview link is generated instantly and can be shared with team members for feedback.

## Replace the image that appears when you share your project

To replace the image that appears when you share your project there are two approaches. The first one involves simply prompting the AI to do this, whilst attaching the desired image to the message. 

<Note>
  **Example prompt**

  You can upload the image directly into the prompt, by for example copy and pasting it. This ensures the system recognizes the correct image without needing an external link.

  ```
  Can you change the image that appears when the site is shared on social media platforms to the one above?
  ```
</Note>

The second one requires that you connect your project to Github and then update the corresponding file. 

1. Click on **Edit code** in your project(top right)

2. Connect your project to GitHub if you havenâ€™t already. You can follow our [guide to connect your project](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration). 

3. Open the repository for your project, navigate to the `public` folder, and locate the file `og-image.png`.

4. Delete the `og-image.png` file and upload your desired image in its place.

5. Rename your new image to `og-image.png`.

6. Redeploy your project to apply the changes.
