Once your web app is ready, you can **deploy it** and share it with the world. You also have the option to **share a work-in-progress version** to gather feedback before going live. Lovable makes it simple to publish, iterate, and distribute your applications with just a few clicks.

<Tip>
  Your published app will be accessible to anyone with the link. Make sure
  you're ready to share before publishing!
</Tip>

## Publishing your app

When your project is ready, **publish it to generate a shareable URL.** This makes it easy to showcase your application or share it with collaborators and stakeholders.

     notification once it's complete.

## Previewing Your App

Previewing allows you to **see your latest changes** without affecting the live, published version.

<Info>
  **Use previewing for iterative development**

  Previewing is very handy as it allows you and others to view the latest changes without affecting the live, published version of your application.

  We've noticed users using it for iterative development and getting real-time feedback, as well as for collaborative reviews and testing before final deployment.
</Info>

To preview:

1. Open the **Share** dialog.

2. Locate the **Preview** section.

3. Click the generated **preview link** to view or share your work-in-progress updates.

The preview link is generated instantly and can be shared with team members for feedback.

## SEO: Customizing Your Shared Image

When sharing your project on social media, you can customize the preview image in two ways:

### **Option 1: Let AI Handle It**

Upload an image and use a simple prompt like:

<Note>
  **Example prompt**

  ```
  Can you change the image that appears when the site is shared on social media platforms to the one above?
  ```
</Note>

### **Option 2: Manually Update via GitHub**

1. Click **Edit code** (top right of your project).

2. Connect your project to GitHub if you haven’t already. Follow our [GitHub integration guide](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration).

3. Open your project repository and navigate to the `public` folder.

4. Replace the existing `og-image.png` with your new image.

5. Rename your new image to `og-image.png`.

6. **Redeploy your project** to apply the changes.
