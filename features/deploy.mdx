Once your web app is ready, you can **deploy it** and share it with the world. You also have the option to **share a work-in-progress version** to gather feedback before going live. Lovable makes it simple to publish, iterate, and distribute your applications with just a few clicks.

<Tip>
  Your published app will be accessible to anyone with the link. Make sure
  you're ready to share before publishing!
</Tip>

## Publishing your app

When your project is ready, **publish it to generate a shareable URL.** This makes it easy to showcase your application or share it with collaborators and stakeholders.

    <Info>
      **Use previewing for iterative development**

      Previewing is very handy as it allows you and others to view the latest changes without affecting the live, published version of your application.

      We've noticed users using it for iterative development and getting real-time feedback, as well as for collaborative reviews and testing before final deployment.
    </Info>

    Previewing allows you to **see your latest changes** without affecting the live, published version.

    To preview:

    1. Open the **Share** dialog.

    2. Locate the **Preview** section.

    3. Click the generated **preview link** to view or share your work-in-progress updates.

    The preview link is generated instantly and can be shared with team members for feedback.
