## Visual Edits&#x20;

Lovable brings programming into the hands of non-technical people, but we knew from working closely with designers that having to chat with AI for every small edit wasn't ideal. Visual Edits emerged from this collaboration, combining AI-powered development with precise Tailwind-native visual control. It's about giving everyone the power to build and refine their vision, whether through natural language or direct manipulation.

The **Visual Edit** tool in Lovable enables precise edits to specific UI components, offering flexibility and control in your design process. Activate the tool from the editor toolbar, hover over the desired element (e.g., button, text, image), and click to bring up editing options. You can update attributes like text, colors, layout, or functionality directly.

For more complex adjustments, use AI-powered prompts to fine-tune your edits. Preview your changes in real-time and save them when satisfied. This feature streamlines targeted edits, helping you refine your designs effortlessly.

## Using the Figma Integration

Designers can now export their Figma designs directly into Lovable to build full-stack apps without needing developers.

This [Figma-to-code guide](https://lovable.dev/blog/2025-01-22-figma-to-lovable-builder-io-native-integration) walks you through every step, from structuring Figma designs to using Builder.io’s plugin and leveraging Lovable for seamless app creation.

## Knowledge Files

Every project has its own unique context, goals, and challenges. A knowledge file captures this *custom context* and serves as a living document that evolves with your project.
