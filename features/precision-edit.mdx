### Using the Select feature

The **Select** tool in Lovable enables precise edits to specific UI components, offering flexibility and control in your design process. Activate the tool from the editor toolbar, hover over the desired element (e.g., button, text, image), and click to bring up editing options. You can update attributes like text, colors, layout, or functionality directly.

For more complex adjustments, combine the **Select** tool with prompts for fine-tuning. Preview your changes in real-time and save them when satisfied. This feature streamlines targeted edits, helping you refine your designs effortlessly.

This [Figma-to-code guide](https://lovable.dev/blog/2025-01-22-figma-to-lovable-builder-io-native-integration) walks you through every step, from structuring Figma designs to using Builder.ioâ€™s plugin and leveraging Lovable for seamless app creation.

## Visual Edits&#x20;

Lovable brings programming into the hands of non-technical people, but we knew from working closely with designers that having to chat with AI for every small edit wasn't ideal. Visual Edits emerged from this collaboration, combining AI-powered development with precise Tailwind-native visual control. It's about giving everyone the power to build and refine their vision, whether through natural language or direct manipulation.
