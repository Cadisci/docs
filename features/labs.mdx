## **GitHub Branch Switching**

Select the branch to make edits to in your GitHub repository. To switch branches in GitHub through the Lovable editor:

1. In Dev Mode, open the Git panel
2. Select the branch dropdown
3. Choose the branch you want to switch to (e.g., "dev")
4. If the branch doesn't exist, click "Create new branch"
5. Your workspace will update to reflect the selected branch

<Warning>
  ### **Important Notes:**

  - Commit or stash any uncommitted changes before switching branches
  - If you encounter "Branch not found" errors, pull the latest changes from the remote repository first
  - If you can't switch branches, check if you have untracked files that would be overwritten
  - Branch switching will change all files in your workspace to match that branch
  - Lovable primarily syncs with your repository's default branch (usually main)
</Warning>

<Note>
  If you need to work with a different branch as your primary branch, you can change the default branch in your GitHub repository settings.
