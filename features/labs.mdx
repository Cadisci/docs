## What is Labs?

These features are experimental, so they might be modified or be removed at any time.

Labs is accessible under your  tab.

## Dev Mode

Until today, viewing your code required you to connect your Lovable project to a GitHub account.

With Dev Mode you can now view the full code repository backing your Lovable project directly in the Lovable Editor.

For those who want even more control, **you can now enable code editing** as well in [Account > Settings > Labs](https://lovable.dev/settings/account#labs). This experimental feature will allow you to edit code files directly in Lovable—no need to switch between multiple tools.

<Info>
  Code editing in Dev Mode is only available for all paid users.

## Chat Mode

Imagine having an AI-powered partner that understands your product-building process, suggests improvements, and helps you debug complex issues—all within the same environment. With **Chat Mode**, Lovable goes beyond just generating code; it becomes an interactive assistant guiding you through every phase of development. It helps founders think critically, plan effectively, debug intelligently, and ship confidently.

<Note>
  Because these capabilities come with additional costs, messages in Chat Mode will now start counting towards your message limit.

### **Top 15 Chat Mode Use Cases**

 1. **Efficient debugging** by explaining errors, offering step-by-step breakdowns, and resolving issues when Lovable got stuck in loops.
 2. **Optimized feature implementation** by identifying the minimal necessary changes required for new functionality.
 3. **Effective system architecture**, planning database structures, relationships, and scalability strategies.
 4. **Streamlined development**, collecting and refining feature ideas before implementation.
 5. **Informed product decisions**, such as debating whether to fork a product or consolidate functions.
 6. **Enhanced documentation and knowledge storage**, keeping development organized and reducing redundant prompts.
 7. **Debugging Lovable itself**, such as redeploying edge functions when Supabase connections were lost.
 8. **Guidance for non-specialists**, acting as an AI tutor for troubleshooting, from password resets to API integrations.
 9. **Prompt generation and refinement**, improving workflows through clearer, more precise instructions.
10. **Decision-making assistance**, analyzing multiple solutions before executing changes.
11. **Product management support**, structuring features, onboarding flows, and pricing models.
12. **Improved collaboration**, acting as a bridge between developers and non-technical founders.
13. **Reduced trial-and-error**, preventing mistakes before they happen and saving hours of work.
14. **Better AI-generated code quality**, refining outputs for maintainability, performance, and best practices.
15. **Real-time coding feedback**, offering suggestions to improve readability, efficiency, and adherence to standards.

Lovable’s **Chat Mode** is redefining the **no-code/low-code development experience**. It bridges the gap between great ideas and fully functional products, making complex software **accessible** to founders who previously relied on engineers.
