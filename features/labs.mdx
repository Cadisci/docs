## Chat Mode

Lovableâ€™s Chat Mode is an experimental feature designed to enhance your workflow by allowing you to interact with Lovable through chat without directly editing your project. It was launched a couple weeks ago and have gotten very good feedback from early testers. We have now started to extend its capabilities and its starting to feel like talking to a seasoned CTO who knows your projects and goals inside and out.

<Note>
  Because these capabilities come with additional costs, messages in Chat Mode will now start counting towards your message limit.
