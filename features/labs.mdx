## What is Labs?

These experimental features may change or be removed at any time.

You can access Labs from your Account Setting tab in the Lovable Editor.

Dev Mode

Previously, viewing your code required connecting your Lovable project to GitHub.

With Dev Mode you can now view the full code repository backing your Lovable project directly in the Lovable project editor.

[More on this here](https://x.com/lovable_dev/status/1895500151889768596).

For those who want even more control, **you can now enable code editing** as well in [Account \> Settings \> Labs](https://lovable.dev/settings/account#labs). This experimental feature will allow you to edit code files directly in Lovable—no need to switch between multiple tools.

<Info>
  Code editing in Dev Mode is available exclusively to paid users.

## Chat Mode

Chat Mode is your AI-powered development partner—offering insights, debugging help, and product-building guidance within the Lovable Editor. With **Chat Mode**, Lovable goes beyond just generating code; it becomes an interactive assistant guiding you through every phase of development. It helps founders think critically, plan effectively, debug intelligently, and ship confidently.

<Note>
  Because these capabilities come with additional costs, messages in Chat Mode will now start counting towards your message limit.

### **Top 15 Chat Mode Use Cases**

 1. **Efficient debugging** by explaining errors, offering step-by-step breakdowns, and resolving issues when Lovable got stuck in loops.
 2. **Optimized feature implementation** by identifying the minimal necessary changes required for new functionality.
 3. **Effective system architecture**, planning database structures, relationships, and scalability strategies.
 4. **Streamlined development**, collecting and refining feature ideas before implementation.
 5. **Informed product decisions**, such as debating whether to fork a product or consolidate functions.
 6. **Enhanced documentation and knowledge storage**, keeping development organized and reducing redundant prompts.
 7. **Debugging Lovable itself**, such as redeploying edge functions when Supabase connections were lost.
 8. **Guidance for non-specialists**, acting as an AI tutor for troubleshooting, from password resets to API integrations.
 9. **Prompt generation and refinement**, improving workflows through clearer, more precise instructions.
10. **Decision-making assistance**, analyzing multiple solutions before executing changes.
11. **Product management support**, structuring features, onboarding flows, and pricing models.
12. **Improved collaboration**, acting as a bridge between developers and non-technical founders.
13. **Reduced trial-and-error**, preventing mistakes before they happen and saving hours of work.
14. **Better AI-generated code quality**, refining outputs for maintainability, performance, and best practices.
15. **Real-time coding feedback**, offering suggestions to improve readability, efficiency, and adherence to standards.

Chat Mode transforms the no-code/low-code experience, bridging ideas and fully functional products. It bridges the gap between great ideas and fully functional products, making complex software **accessible** to founders who previously relied on engineers.

## **GitHub Branch Switching**

Select the branch to make edits to in your GitHub repository. To switch branches in GitHub through the Lovable editor:

1. In Dev Mode, open the Git panel
2. Select the branch dropdown
3. Choose the branch you want to switch to (e.g., "dev")
4. If the branch doesn't exist, click "Create new branch"
5. Your workspace will update to reflect the selected branch

<Warning>
  ### **Important Notes:**

  - Commit or stash any uncommitted changes before switching branches
  - If you encounter "Branch not found" errors, pull the latest changes from the remote repository first
  - If you can't switch branches, check if you have untracked files that would be overwritten
  - Branch switching will change all files in your workspace to match that branch
  - Lovable primarily syncs with your repository's default branch (usually main)
</Warning>

<Note>
  If you need to work with a different branch as your primary branch, you can change the default branch in your GitHub repository settings.
